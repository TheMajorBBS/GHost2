; List the IP addresses you want to silently ignore (similar to banning, but no output is sent to the client, nor is any message added to the log file)
; This is useful if you have a service that monitors your server for uptime, such as StatusCake or UptimeRobot.  Speaking of which, the IPs used for
; those services are automatically downloaded every hour, so you won't have to manually add them or keep this list up to date with their changing list
; of IP addresses
;
; This list is combined with the StatusCake and UptimeRobot lists in the ignored-ips-combined.txt file -- Don't modify that file directly, or your changes
; will be lost the next time the update runs.  Only ever edit the ignored-ips.txt file.
;
; See banned-ips.txt for an example of how to format ip entries
