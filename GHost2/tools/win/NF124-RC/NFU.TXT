==============================================
NetFoss Utilities for Win32 Doors version 1.2x
==============================================

NFU allows DOS BBS software using NetFoss to run Win32 doors.
NFU currently has three functions:

1. Builds a DOOR32.SYS drop file, needed by most Win32 BBS Doors.
   It does this by reading user data from the DOOR.SYS drop file, and also
   reading the Telnet Socket Handle from the Windows Environment Variable
   %SOCKET%.

2. Allows a Win32 application to run from a DOS BBS Shell, which must be
   passed on the NFU command line.

3. It has an option to also pass keystrokes to the Console when the door
   launches, but this does not work for non-Console GUI doors. This can be
   useful for doors that ask if ANSI is supported, or asks the user for
   their name. It can also be used to allowing a DOS BBS to shell to a
   Win32 BBS that uses the same userbase.

NFU [path to DOOR.SYS] ["Door Command line + parameters in quotes"] <Opt par>

Examples:
   NFU c:\proboard\node1 "c:\proboard\dark32\dark32.exe /n1"
   NFU . "c:\proboard\dark32\dark32.exe /n1" (dot uses current directory)

Shortcuts:
    $  - Replaced by path+\ only of DOOR32.SYS
    ^  - Replaced by path+\filename of DOOR32.SYS

Optional parameters:
   /Q  - Quiet Mode: No console output except for error messages
   /R  - RIP Enable: Without this, RIP Emulation in DOOR.SYS is ignored
   /YN - Send Yes/No character to a door that asks user if they have ANSI
   /K="x" - Stuff keyboard buffer with one character or a string of characters
            Keyboard macros: |=Enter, !N=User Name, !A=User Alias, !P=Password

The second parameter can be a batch file (.BAT or .CMD), or an executable.
Keyboard macros are case sensitive.


IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS
======================

If you are using Net2BBS version 1.14 or later then skip the next two steps
and continue on to the the "Adding your DOOR32 to your BBS" section.
Net2BBS 1.14 and later automatically updates the %SOCKET% environment variable
with the Telnet Socket Handle.


Changes to your telnet server command line:
-------------------------------------------

If your current telnet server command line may look something like this:
Command=c:\netfoss\nf.bat /n*N /h*H c:\pb\proboard.bat *N

As you can see, the BBS batch file (in this case proboard.bat) is only being
passed the node number, (using the *N macro) which it will be able to accessed
as variable %1 since it is the first parameter passed.

You will need to change the command line to also pass the Socket Handle
(using the *H macro), as the second parameter being passed to proboard.bat, so
it will be accessable as variable %2.

The new telnet server command line will look like this after the change:
Command=c:\netfoss\nf.bat /n*N /h*H c:\proboard\proboard.bat *N *H


Changes to the BBS batch file:
------------------------------

Add the following line to proboard.bat before it runs the BBS software:
set SOCKET=%2

This will store the socket handle into the environment variable %SOCKET%,
which can later be accessed by NFU so the socket handle can be placed in the
DOOR32.SYS drop file it creates.

Adding your DOOR32 door to your BBS:
------------------------------------

In order for a DOS BBS to run a Win32 Door, the Door command line or batch
file must be passed through NFU on the second command line parameter shown
above. The Door command line must be contained within quote marks to allow
spaces between any passed parameters.

Below are setup examples for the following 32-bit Windows doors:

BBSLink
DoorParty
MannIRC
LORD32
Darkness
DoorMud
Ambroshia
Pimp Wars
Usurper
Jezibel
Food Fight 2004


BBSLink
-------

BBSLink is an InterBBS Game Server using a modifed version of Manning's Telnet Door
which automaticly logs the user into their Server and directly into the desired door
using the BBS Sysops pre-assigned credentials.
You can join for free at http://bbsnet.net

How to install BBSlink for a DOS BBS:

1. Extract BBSlink to a directory/folder. (In this example we will assume C:\BBSLINK)
   and install Microsoft DotNet (.NET), which is required by the RM Library .DLL

2. Edit your BBSLINK.BAT file, and fill in the 3 codes provided by the BBSLink admin.
   While you are editing this batch file, you will need to add a "Change Directory"
   command to change to its directory somewhere before the bbslink.exe line:
   CD\BBSLINK
   If you are running your BBS from a different drive then BBSLink is on, then you may
   also want to add a "C:" command on the line above it.

3. In your BBS software, configure your door to run a Command Line such as this example,
   which will run NFU.EXE and pass the path-only of your BBS Nodes dropfile directory,
   as well as the BBSLINK.BAT that NFU will execute along with its needed parameters.
   Say for example, that your BBS software is ProBoard and your BBS directory structure is
   C:\PB  (main BBS directory)
   C:\PB\NODE1   (Node 1 dropfile directory)
   C:\PB\NODE2   (Node 2 dropfile directory)

   ProBoard BBS uses the following Door Command Line macros:
       *# is replaced by the Node number
       *D tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS drop file, and is filtered out. 
   So the following type-7 Command Line could be configured for this door in ProCfg:
   So the following type-7 Command Line could be configured for this door in ProCfg:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node*# "c:\bbslink\bbslink.bat lord C:\pb\node*#\DOOR32.SYS" *D

   Note that for node 1, the above command line would be translated by the BBS as so:
   c:\pb\nfu.exe c:\pb\node1 "c:\bbslink\bbslink.bat lord c:\pb\node1\DOOR32.SYS"

   Since ProBoard and most other BBS software sets the current directory as the node's
   dropfile directory before executing a door, you could shorten the size of the
   first parameter by replacing the path to the dropfile diretory shown above with just
   a ".", telling NFU to use the current directory to read door.sys from and to create
   the DOOR32.SYS in, like so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\bbslink\bbslink.bat lord c:\pb\node1\DOOR32.SYS" *D

   You could also shorten the second parameter by replacing the "Full path+\DOOR32.SYS"
   with a "^" character, like so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\bbslink\bbslink.bat lord ^" *D

   Note: the *D in this example is only used to tell ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS
   drop file. Other BBS software will have different ways of configuring this which
   are often not command line macros. Many BBS programs create the DOOR.SYS by default.

   Check your BBS documentation on what macro it uses to pass the node number. While
   Proboard uses *#, most BBS software use *N and many use other macros.

4. Once you have BBSLink working sucessfully with the above configuration for the LORD
   door, simply create additional menu options as above for the other door games
   available on BBSlink, replacing the word "lord" with one of the other door codes,
   such as lord2, teos, ooww, tw, luna, etc. A complete list of codes is available at
   http://www.bbslink.net/sysop/

   Avoid these common mistakes:
   * Don't leave out the quote marks on the Command Line passed to NFU. NFU requires two
     parameters (1: The dropfile path to the door.sys, 2: the full command line to execute),
     and this second parameter must be in quotes if it contains its own set of parameters.
   * Do not include the name of DOOR.SYS in parameter 1, just the path where it is located
     NFU will read the DOOR.SYS dropfile here, and will create the DOOR32.SYS dropfile in
     the same directory before executing the Command Line in parameter 2.
   * BBSLink requires NOT ONLY the path to a DOOR32.SYS file as stated in it's documentation,
     it also requires the DOOR32.SYS filename to be included in that path.


DoorParty
---------
DoorParty is an InterBBS Game Server using Manning's Telnet Door by Rick Parrish of R&M
software, as well as the DoorParty Connector software. This combination automaticly logs
the user into the DoorParty Server and directly into the desired door using the BBS Sysops
pre-assigned credentials. You can join for free at http://wiki.throwbackbbs.com/doku.php

DoorParty provides several examples of how to set it up using NetFoss and NFU in their Wiki.

How to set DoorParty up on a Telegard (DOS) BBS:
http://wiki.throwbackbbs.com/doku.php?id=howto:telegard_windows_dpc

How to set DoorParty up on a GAP (DOS) BBS:
http://wiki.throwbackbbs.com/doku.php?id=howto:gap_windows_dpc

At the time of this writing, other DOS BBS examples were being added to the DoorParty
Wiki, including EzyCom and WWIV BBSes.


MannIRC Door
------------

MannIRC is a Bitch-X style IRC client for BBS systems by Rick Parrish of R&M Software,
and is available from http://randm.ca

Here is how to install it.

1. Extract MANNIRC.RAR to a directory/folder. (In this example we will use C:\PB\MANNIRC)

2. Open MannIRC.ini in your favourite text editor, and edit the options as described in
   MANNIRC.HTML

3. In your BBS software, configure your door to run a Command Line such as this example,
   which will run NFU.EXE and pass the path-only of your BBS Nodes dropfile directory,
   as well as the MANNIRC.EXE that NFU will execute along with its needed node parameter.
   Say for example, that your BBS software is ProBoard and your BBS directory structure is
   C:\PB  (main BBS directory)
   C:\PB\NODE1   (Node 1 dropfile directory)
   C:\PB\NODE2   (Node 2 dropfile directory)

   ProBoard BBS uses the following Door Command Line macros:
       *# is replaced by the Node number
       *D tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS drop file, and is filtered out. 
   So the following type-7 Command Line could be configured for this door in ProCfg:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node*# "c:\pb\mannirc\mannirc.exe c:\pb\node\*#door32.sys" *D

   Note that for node 1, the above command line would be translated by the BBS as so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node1 "c:\pb\mannirc\mannirc.exe c:\pb\node1\door32.sys"

   If your BBS software automaticly sets the current directory as the node's dropfile
   directory before executing a door, you can shorten the size of the first parameter
   replacing the path to the dropfile diretory shown above in parameter 1 with just a
   ".", telling NFU to use the current directory to read door.sys from and to
   create the door32.sys in, like so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\mannirc\mannirc.exe c:\pb\node\*#door32.sys" *D

   To make the second parameter shorter, you can use the "^" shortcut character to replace
   the path and filename of the DOOR32.SYS like so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\mannirc\mannirc.exe ^" *D

   (Leave out the *D if not using ProBoard - this tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS)



LORD32
------ 

Legend of the Red Dragon Win32 edition was never released to the public. It was written
by Michael Preslar while he worked for Metropolis Gameport, and the 2005 beta version
can be found on several BBS sites. Only the DOS edition is available from gameport.com.

Here is how to install it:

1. Extract 32LO407B.ZIP to a directory/folder. In this example
   we will assume C:\PB\LORD32

2. Run LORDCFG.EXE, and if this is a new installation it will prompt you to create
   a new LORD.DAT file. 
   Select Configure Nodes, and Use the "[" and "]" keys to go forward and back one node,
   and for each node page, set the following:
      BBS Software: DOOR.SYS
      Path to Dropfile: <the path where your BBS creates the DOOR.SYS for this node>
      Fossil/Internal:  Regular Fossil Driver
  Once all nodes are configured, press escape to exit.

3. In your BBS software, configure your door to run a Command Line such as this example,
   which will run NFU.EXE and pass the path-only of your BBS Nodes dropfile directory,
   as well as the LORD32.EXE that NFU will execute along with its needed node parameter.
   Say for example, that your BBS software is ProBoard and your BBS directory structure is
   C:\PB  (main BBS directory)
   C:\PB\NODE1   (Node 1 dropfile directory)
   C:\PB\NODE2   (Node 2 dropfile directory)

   ProBoard BBS uses the following Door Command Line macros:
       *# is replaced by the Node number
       *D tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS drop file, and is filtered out. 
   So the following type-7 Command Line could be configured for this door in ProCfg:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node*# "c:\pb\lord32\lord.exe -Dc:\pb\node*#\door32.sys" *D

   Note that for node 1, the above command line would be translated by the BBS as so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node1 "c:\pb\lord32\lord32.exe -Dc:\pb\node1\door32.sys"

   If your BBS software automaticly sets the current directory as the node's dropfile
   directory before executing a door, you can shorten the size of the first parameter by
   replacing the path to the dropfile diretory shown above in parameter 1 with just a
   ".", telling NFU to use the current directory to read door.sys from and to
   create the door32.sys in, like so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\lord32\lord32.exe -Dc:\pb\node*#\door32.sys" *D

   You can also shorten the second parameter by replacing the path+\door32.sys to
   with the "^" character like so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\lord32\lord32.exe -D^" *D

   (Leave out the *D if not using ProBoard - this tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS)


Darkness
--------

Darkness was one of the first DOOR32 door games released. It is a LORD style game,
by Jack Phlash of Demonic, and is available from Distortion BBS at http://d1st.org
Here is how to install it.

1. Extract DRK100B3.ZIP the D112001.ZIP update to a directory/folder. In this example
   we will assume C:\PB\DARK32

2. Run DARKCFG.EXE, and select [c] BBS and modem config.
   Use the "[" and "]" keys to go forward and back one node, and for each node page,
   you will need to select "[d] Drop file directory" and change it to the correct
   directory for your BBS. For example, C:\PB\NODE1\  for Node 1
   Once you have configured all your nodes, press [q] twice to quit and save changes.

3. In your BBS software, configure your door to run a Command Line such as this example,
   which will run NFU.EXE and pass the path-only of your BBS Nodes dropfile directory,
   as well as the DARK32.EXE that NFU will execute along with its needed node parameter.
   Say for example, that your BBS software is ProBoard and your BBS directory structure is
   C:\PB  (main BBS directory)
   C:\PB\NODE1   (Node 1 dropfile directory)
   C:\PB\NODE2   (Node 2 dropfile directory)

   ProBoard BBS uses the following Door Command Line macros:
       *# is replaced by the Node number
       *D tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS drop file, and is filtered out. 
   So the following type-7 Command Line could be configured for this door in ProCfg:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node*# "c:\pb\dark32\dark32.exe /N*#" *D

   Note that for node 1, the above command line would be translated by the BBS as so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node1 "c:\pb\dark32\dark32.exe /N1"

   If your BBS software automaticly sets the current directory as the node's dropfile
   directory before executing a door, you can shorten the size of the first parameter by
   replacing the path to the dropfile diretory shown above in parameter 1 with just a
   ".", telling NFU to use the current directory to read door.sys from and to
   create the door32.sys in, like so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\dark32\dark32.exe /N1" *D

   (Leave out the *D if not using ProBoard - this tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS)


DoorMud
-------

DoorMud - Land of the Forgotten is a Multi User Dungeon (MUD) game by Evan Elias, and
it's available from http://dmud.thebbs.org

Here is how to install it:

1. Extract the DOOR32 version of DoorMud (DMUD099D.ZIP) to a directory/folder.
   (In this example we will assume C:\PB\DMUD)

2. You must first run the door in local mode by executing "dmud32d.exe -l".  The game will
   automatically finish its installation the first time you run it in local mode.

3. In your BBS software, configure your door to run a Command Line such as this example,
   which will run NFU.EXE and pass the path-only of your BBS Nodes dropfile directory,
   as well as the DMUDD32.EXE that NFU will execute along with its needed parameters.
   Say for example, that your BBS software is ProBoard and your BBS directory structure is
   C:\PB  (main BBS directory)
   C:\PB\NODE1   (Node 1 dropfile directory)
   C:\PB\NODE2   (Node 2 dropfile directory)
 
   ProBoard BBS uses the following Door Command Line macros:
       *# is replaced by the Node number
       *D tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS drop file, and is filtered out. 
   So the following type-7 Command Line could be configured for this door in ProCfg:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node*# "c:\pb\dmud\dmudd32.exe -N *# -D c:\pb\node*#" *D

   Note that for node 1, the above command line would be translated by the BBS as so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node1 "c:\pb\dmud\dmudd32.exe -N 1 -D c:\pb\node1"

   If your BBS software automaticly sets the current directory as the node's dropfile
   directory before executing a door, you can shorten the size of the first parameter by
   replacing the path to the dropfile diretory shown above in parameter 1 with just a
   ".", telling NFU to use the current directory to read door.sys from and to
   create the door32.sys in, like so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\dmud\dmudd32.exe -N *# -D c:\pb\node*#" *D

   You can also shorten the second parameter by replacing the path (only) to
   the DOOR32.SYS file (without the filename) with the "$" character like so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\dmud\dmudd32.exe -N *# -D $" *D

   (Leave out the *D if not using ProBoard - this tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS)
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Above this point we have provided examples with detailed descriptions of the various
ways the Door Command Line can be entered using the shortcuts to minimize the size
of the Command line. The examples below include less details to avoid repetition.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ambroshia
---------

Ambroshia - The Test of Time is a Multi User Dungeon (MUD) game by Dominic Carretto, and
it's available from http://ambroshia.thebbs.org

Here is how to install it: (Assuming that your BBS uses *# as the node macro)

1. Extract the Win32 version of Ambroishia (AMB4031.ZIP) to a directory/folder.
   (In this example we will assume C:\PB\AMBV4)

2. In your BBS software, configure your door to run a Command Line such as this example:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node*# "c:\pb\amb\amblaunch.exe /n *# /d c:\pb\node*#\door32.sys" *D

   Note that for node 1, the above command line would be translated by the BBS as so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node1 C:\PB\amb\amblaunch.exe /n 1 /d c:\pb\node1\door.sys"

   If your BBS software automaticly sets the current directory as the node's dropfile
   directory before executing a door, you can shorten the size of parameter 1 like this:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\amb\amblaunch.exe /n *# /d c:\pb\node*#\door32.sys" *D

   You can also shorten the second parameter by replacing the path (only) to   
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\amb\amblaunch.exe /n *# /d ^" *D

   (Leave out the *D if not using ProBoard - this tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS)


Pimpwars
--------

PimpWars is another classic RPG in which you play a pimp. It was updated to Win32 by
James Coyle of MysticBBS fame.

James left one annoying "feature" from the original game, in which it ignores the ANSI
graphics setting found in the drop file, and instead asks the user "Use ANSI? (Y/N)"
when it start up. NFU can automaticlly answer this question, so it's never even seen by
the user by adding the /YN switch as the third parameter.

Here is how to install it: (Assuming that your BBS uses *# as the node macro)

1. Extract PW_153W.ZIP to a directory/folder. In this example we will assume C:\PB\PIMPWARS)

2. In your BBS software, configure your door to run a Command Line such as this example:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node*# "c:\pb\pimpwars\pimpwars.exe c:\pb\node*#\door32.sys *#" /YN *D

   Note that for node 1, the above command line would be translated by the BBS as so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node1 "c:\pb\pimpwars\pimpwars.exe c:\pb\node1\door32.sys 1" /YN *D

   If your BBS software automaticly sets the current directory as the node's dropfile
   directory before executing a door, you can shorten the size of parameter 1 like this:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\pimpwars\pimpwars.exe c:\pb\node*#\door32.sys *N" /YN *D

   You can also shorten the second parameter by replacing the path+/DOOR32.SYS with "^":
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\pimpwars\pimpwars.exe ^ *#" /YN *D

   (Leave out the *D if not using ProBoard - this tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS)


Jezabel
-------

Jezabel is an RPG in which you are a virus and battle other malware written by DreamMaster.
It's available from http://dreamlandbbs.org.

Here is how to install it: (Assuming that your BBS uses *# as the node macro)

1. Extract JZBL25.ZIP to a directory/folder. In this example we will assume C:\pb\jez)

2. In your BBS software, configure your door to run a Command Line such as this example:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node*# "c:\pb\jez\jezw32.exe c:\pb\node*#\door32.sys" *D

   Note that for node 1, the above command line would be translated by the BBS as so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node1 C:\pb\jez\jezw32.exe c:\pb\node1\door.sys"

   If your BBS software automaticly sets the current directory as the node's dropfile
   directory before executing a door, you can shorten the size of parameter 1 like this:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . C:\pb\jez\jezw32.exe c:\pb\node*#\door.sys"

   You can also shorten the second parameter by replacing the path+/DOOR32.SYS with "^":   
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . C:\pb\jez\jezw32.exe ^" *D

   (Leave out the *D if not using ProBoard - this tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS)


Food Fight 2004
---------------

Food Fight 2004 was a Win32 remake of the Classic DOS Food Fight door, written by
Chris Martino. 


1. Extract FF2K4V24.ZIP to a directory/folder. In this example we will assume C:\PB\FOOD)

2. In your BBS software, configure your door to run a Command Line such as this example:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node*# "c:\pb\food\ff2k4.exe -Dc:\pb\node*#\door32.sys" *D

   Note that for node 1, the above command line would be translated by the BBS as so:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe c:\pb\node1 "c:\pb\food\ff2k4.exe -Dc:\pb\node1\door32.sys"

   If your BBS software automaticly sets the current directory as the node's dropfile
   directory before executing a door, you can shorten the size of parameter 1 like this:
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . "c:\pb\food\ff2k4.exe -Dc:\pb\node*#\door32.sys" *D

   You can also shorten the second parameter by replacing the path+/DOOR32.SYS with "^":   
   c:\netfoss\nfu.exe . C:\pb\jez\jezw32.exe ^" *D

   (Leave out the *D if not using ProBoard - this tells ProBoard to create a DOOR.SYS)

Clans
-----
Clans is an excellent door, but unfortunatly it was ported to Win32 using the OpenDoors
toolkit, which like many doors results in a non-console Window for the local node.
It's been reported that minimizing this window with the -silent switch will cause it
to crash, so I would suggest sticking with the DOS version of Clans which runs very
fast under NetFoss.



Other Win32 doors that were tested but not found to be worthwhile documenting:
MyCroft doors: sherlock Holmes, Fictitious Stock Exchange, Steller Quest, U-Boat.
Atlantis doors: Kentucky Derby, Vegas Slots 
Tournament Trivia (from DoorMud author)
KFTO Boxing (The_Vipah)
BBS Simulator (Zoob)
Usurper - Great classic game but the Win32 version is still in beta and it requires upgrading
from other versions currently.


Win32 doors that appear not to work:
------------------------------------
The Online Pub for Windows by Paul Sidorsky only supports Windows COM port handles,
and not TCP Sockets, so it will not work.

The Telnet Door by Enigma/Dink released with his Citrisoft kit appears to only support
Windows COM Port handles, and not TCP Sockets, so it will not work.

The Telnet Door by Mercyful Fate will get as far as making a remote connection, but once
it displays the remote logon screen, it will disconnect (or perhaps the remote BBS
disconnects due to a telnet negotiation issue).
If anyone is able to get this to work correctly, please let me know.

The only telnet door that appears to work so far is the one by Rick at R&M, which uses
settings simular to the one for BBSLink without needing a batch file.
