GHost/2 Door Server
===================

## Description
A door server built to replace the functionality of the original Major/WorldGroup BBS GHost system.  
But GHost/2 will lend itself to any BBS that has the ability to use RLogin.
GHost/2 is derived from Rick Parrish's [GameSrv](https://github.com/rickparrish/GameSrv)


## Building
If you plan to build from source you will also need the [RMLibUI](https://github.com/rickparrish/RMLibUI) library.
This current project is built in Visual Studio 2019.
