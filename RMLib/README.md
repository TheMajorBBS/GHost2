R&M Library (RMLib)
===================

RMLib contains nonvisual support classes used by multiple R&M Software programs.  It contains mostly code I've written, but some has been collected from various sources over the years.  Whenever possible I've tried to identify these sources, so it's clear what wasn't written by me.<br />
<br />
I occasionally make breaking changes to the library, so I don't really recommend using RMLib, unless you need it to compile another R&M Software program.
