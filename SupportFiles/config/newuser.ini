; Add/remove entries in here to control which questions are asked to new users, and how they should behave
; (ie are they required or optional, should they be validated against a certain rule or does anything go, etc)
; 
; The questions will be asked in the order they appear in this file
;
; NOTE: Alias and Password are hardcoded -- no need to add them as questions in this file
;
; The section name (the text in []) is the key name that will be used when storing the user's response in their .ini file
;     It is also how you'll refer to it as a message variable.  For example [RealName] in this file can be used in a message
;     variable as {REALNAME}
; The Confirm= line controls whether the user should be prompted to re-type the string, to confirm that the first input was good
;     If the user's doesn't type the same string the second time, they'll be asked to start over again
; The Required= line controls whether the user should be required to provide an answer to the question
;     If the user doesn't answer a question, and it is not required, then it goes without saying that the validation will be skipped
; The Validate= line controls whether the user's answer is validated in any way.  Possible validation values are:
;     Email    - User's input must be in the format of an email address.  Useful for...you guessed it, email addresses!
;     TwoWords - User's input must be two or more words (ie, must contain at least 1 space).  Useful for prompting for a name
;     Numeric  - User's input must be a number (decimals allowed).  The approximate range allowed is ±5.0 × 10^−324 to ±1.7 × 10^308
;                Not sure what exactly this one would be useful for, but I threw it in since it was a simple check
;     If you have any other validation types that you think would be useful, just let me know
;
; Prompts for each question must exist in the ansi sub-directory, or the question will be skipped.  File names should be in all lower case
; and use the following format, where SECTIONNAME is the name in brackets for the question:
;
; newuser_enter_SECTIONNAME.ans - The first prompt displayed when asking the question
; newuser_enter_SECTIONNAME_invalid.ans - If a validation is enabled, and the input does not pass validation, this message is displayed
; newuser_enter_SECTIONNAME_confirm.ans - If confirmation is required, this second prompt is displayed before re-asking the question
; newuser_enter_SECTIONNAME_mismatch.ans - If confirmation is required, and the second input does not match the first, this message is displayed
