; List the IP addresses you want to allow to connect to your RLogin server
; You must always list all 4 octets -- just use a * as a wildcard if you want to block a whole class A/B/C
;
; Example to block an individual IP address:
; 1.2.3.4
; Block a whole class A:
; 1.*.*.*
; Block a whole class B:
; 1.2.*.*
; Block a whole class C:
; 1.2.3.*
; Block in a really weird but syntactically valid way:
; 1.*.*.4
;
; If you don't want to implement an RLogin allowlist list, you could delete this file to save a few cycles of unnecessary processing
; for each RLogin connection
;
; For backwards compatability the allowlist defaults to allowing anybody to connect via RLogin
