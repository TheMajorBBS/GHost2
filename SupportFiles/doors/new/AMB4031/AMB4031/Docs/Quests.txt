How to write Quests for Ambroshia v4.0:

Anyone can write a quest for Ambroshia. All it takes is a little bit of
time and some imagination!

Step 1: Open the document called Commands.txt in the Docs directory.

- Read over some of the commands that are listed in it. They are given pretty
detailed information on how to use them plus examples..

Step 2: Open up an existing quest from the Quests directory. This way you can
get an idea of how some quests are created..

Step 3: Open up notepad and begin creating your quest!

Step 4: When you are all done with your quest, save the quest with an extension
of .amb 

Step 5: Open another notepad session and create a little informational doc for
sysops to read. This is where you describe your quest, and the rewards given
to players if they complete your quest. This will make the sysops job of deciding
if your quest un-balances their game a bit easier.

Step 6: Near the top of your informational documentation, please let the sysop know to
add your quest to their Quests.dat file. By inputing an additional line of:
Your Quest Name,Your Name,Quest Name, <--notice the ending comma needs to be there..

Please look at the Quests.dat file in your Data directory for examples..


Thats it!
