--==[UNREGISTERED LIMITATIONS]==--:

Players will be unable to use the depository.
Players cannot access high-level monsters.
Players cannot send romantic mail.
A few other small features disabled..


--==[Installation:]==--:

Just run the installation executable and install to a directory of your choosing.

Maintenance will run every new day when the first player in joins. If you would like
to set maintenance to run at other times, just call AMBLaunch.exe /TRYMAINT in a nightly batch job..

If you notice that Maintenance has not run during the day, and you cannot get it to run. Please run
AMBLaunch.exe /FORCEMAINT <--make sure nobody is online while this is run..

--==[Setup]==--:

Here I will explain how to setup the game in a few different BBS environments.

@@ Local Mode @@:

Just run AMBLAUNCH.EXE /L


@@ Synchronet @@:

Startup Directory: c:\ambv4
Command Line: amblaunch.exe /N %N /D %F /SOCKET %H 
If you would like to hide the local window, add a -SILENT to the end of the command line.

Multiple Users: Yes
Native 32-bit: Yes
BBS Drop File In: Mystic DOOR32.SYS
Place Drop File In: Node Directory


@@ WinServer @@:

Step 1: You must run Ambroshia through a batch file. Copy WCAMB.BAT
from your Ambroshia directory and place it wherever you normally put door
batch files, and edit it as directed in the batch file's comments.

Step 2: Configure your BBS to run the door as "Door32 Compatible" for Door
Type, and "WCAMB.BAT" for the Batch File. Be sure to enable the Multi-user
toggle option.
Using these lines in the bat file.
cd c:\ambv4
c:\ambv4\amblaunch.exe -n %wcnodeid% -d c:\doors\node%wcnodeid%

Step 3: You must copy WinServers DOOR32.DLL file into the directory you put
Ambroshia 4.0 in. This will allow the native support for WinServer in
Ambroshia to work!

To install quests to your game, just edit the Quests.dat file located in the
data directory and input the Quest name followed by a comma, the Authors name 
followed by a comma, then the actual Filename of the quest followed by a ending comma.

Just put the actual quest file into the Quests directory.


--==[Problems]==--:

If maintenance does not run, and you receive a message stating you must manually run maint. Go
to your Ambv4 directory and run AMBLAUNCH /TRYMAINT

Also the game automatically creates daily backups. These are located in the Backups directory
and are named according to the date it was created. To go back to a backup copy, just rename
the file to game.db and copy it into your Data directory.

If you run into a problem installing/setting up the door game, please contact
me and I'll do my best to get you going. I am also available in the irc chat
channel #ambroshia on irc.thebbs.org, as are a number of other sysops/bbs
programmers.
