        A major portion of this software comes from the DDPlus Door Driver
        Package and was written by the authors of that package. The DDPlus
        Doordriver kit has been used for the communications, interrupt
        handling and some utility functions and that part of the software
        remains copyrighted by the authors of the DDplus Package.

        This game is distributed under the Shareware concept. You are
        allowed to operate this game for a trial period of thirty (30)
        days. After this trial period, you must register the game
        or discontinue its usage. Again if you do not agree with this
        then do NOT use this game.


                                REQUIREMENTS:
                                ------------
        At this point in time the only requirements are FILES=10 (or more)
        in your config.sys file and ANSI.SYS. SHARE must also be loaded IF
        you intend to use the game in a multi-node environment OR under
        DesqView. The game is RIP aware but NOT a RIP Game at this time. A
        FOSSIL is NOT required to run the game, although one will be
        supported if it exists. Automatic time slicing support is provided
        to most common multi-taskers as well.

                           Installation
                           ------------

        1. Create a directory for the game:
            example: "WC30\DOORS\GAMEDIR"

        2. Make sure that ALL files listed above from the game package
           are moved into that directory.

        3. Create a node file for every node with DEDIT.EXE.

        4. Create the config file with the same DEDIT.EXE.

        5. To insure proper multi-node use DOS SHARE must be loaded
           prior to the game and prior to DESQview.

        6. In order to run the game program online the following
           parameters may be used.

        "/Bxxxxx"   This tells DRAKE.EXE to lock its baud rate at
        xxxxx.  In order to get the most efficiency out of a high speed
        error correcting modem (9600 baud or above), you may lock the baud
        rate to a speed higher than what the caller is actually using.
        By locking the baud to say 38,400, the modem can compress text data
        that is being sent and achieve a baud rate much higher than the
        actual transmission rate.
        This will lock the baud rate at the same value for all nodes that
        use this command line.  If you perfer a more selective way to lock
        baud use 'LOCKBAUD' command in the DRAKE.(NODE) file.

        "/Cx"     (where x is 1..4) This specifies a comport number.
        Some bbs software does not create door information files (dropfiles)
        that contain the comport number.  If your bbs does have a comport
        listed in the dropfile then there is no need for this parameter.
        The default is comport 0, local mode.

        "/E" - Expanded Memory Specification If your machine has over one
        megabyte of memory, then you may have some available.  GAME.EXE can
        utilize EMS to improve game performance and reduce conventional
        memory requirements.
        This command will tell DRAKE.EXE   to use EMS memory to hold its
        overlay buffer.  Otherwise disc area may be used to hold this buffer.
        This needs a memory manager and when enabled and is compatible with
        DESQview. Default is NOT to use available EMS.

        "/L" or "0"  This tells DRAKE.EXE to load up in LOCAL mode.
        This is good for testing or when a sysop just wants to "try out" the
        door without messing with his BBS setup.  The "/L" mode will ask the
        user for his name and run the door in local mode.

        "/Nx"     (where x is 1..9) This specifies a "node number".
        Some bbs software support multinode environments in which you must
        know the node number of the drop file to use. For example, RBBS-PC
        uses DORINFOx.DEF. If you specified "/N2" then DRAKE.EXE would use
        DORINFO2.DEF.

        "/Pyyy"   This specifies the path to the drop files.
        For example, "/PC:\WILDCAT\WCWORK\NODE1" would tell DRAKE.EXE to
        look for the drop file in C:\WILDCAT\WCWORK\NODE1. If this is left
        out the program assumes the drop file is local.

        "/R" To force local RIP for the sysop. Used only if the program
        has RipLink built in and the door supports RIP.  Use AFTER the
        /L parameter if you are using the door in local mode.

        "/V"    This command will tell DRAKE.EXE not to show any display
        on the local screen.  Only a colored screen and a message will be
        displayed.  The cursor will not move as it will be turned off.
        Saves a little processing on multi-tasking systems.

        "/W"      This flags the program that a network is present even
        though no multitaskers are detected.  This is useful if the door is
        run on a network such as Novell that doesn't use multitaskers.


            COMMON ERRORS
            003  File path not found. Check to make sure the game
                 directory is correctly named as GAMEDIR.
            201  Files not found. Check to make sure that all required
                 games files are in the GAMEDIR directory.

        7. Install the door into your BBS software (see your BBS
           software documentation for more information).  A batch file is
           normally used to do this.  To run the program just have your
           batch file change to the GAMEDIR directory and run GO_DRAKE.BAT -
           Thats all there is to it!  Three different batch files sample
           are included to help you run the game. These are included with
           the game for editing and your use. Remember when writing the
           batch routines for my games you must ensure that the game is
           run from it's home directory AND that the game knows where to
           find the drop file.  Satisfy these two requirements and you
           should have no problems running the game as long as the other
           setup criteria has been met. For dorinfo systems try using the
           following:

                            Sample Batch File
                            -----------------

                 COPY DORINFOx.DEF \RBBS\DOORS\GAMEDIR\*.*
                 CD \RBBS\DOORS\GAMEDIR
                 CALL GO_DRAKE x <-=- NODE number !!DO NOT USE "x"!!
                 del dorinfox.def
                 CD \WC30

            -->  Please note that you replace the "x" with the appropriate
                 node number. Ex: Dorinfo1.def ; Dorinfo2.def ; etc...


        8.  Drakeville creates a TOPTEN.ANS score board. You can set up the
            filename and the path with DEDIT.EXE

        9.  Surprise!  There is NO separate daily maintenance to be
            performed. The first player of each day will automatically run
            the built in maintenance routines.


                     RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNREGISTERED GAME
                     -------------------------------------
           I don't believe in cripling games because there are not registered.
           The only restriction is that the players cannot go above level 5
           before registering the game. After registering the game, the players
           can go up to level 10 and finish the game.

                                  Multinode use
                                  -------------
        This game supports multinode use and provides automatic
        multi-tasker support  (time slice releasing) for a wide variety
        of multi-taskers.
 
               Common Problems (Locked Bauds, High Speed modems, etc)
               ------------------------------------------------------

        1.   The game does NOT require a fossil driver to run.

        2.   If you are running a high speed modem (9600 baud or above),
             then I suggest you run your bbs/mailer/doors at a locked baud
             rate. On high speed error correcting modems, locking the baud
             rate will have a noticeable increase on the speed of text that
             is sent. It's beyond the scope of this document to discuss
             configuring your BBS and mailer for a locked baud rate; you may
             wish to consult those docs for information on that. Here are a
             few things to keep in mind when setting up GAME with a locked
             baud rate:

             a.  When using a locked baud rate, I highly recommend
                 using a  FOSSIL driver. This game will work at high
                 speeds without one though. BNU is a good fossil driver
                 which can even be loaded and unloaded before and after
                 you run this game.

             b.  If you are using a fossil, then make sure to tell the
                 fossil that the port is locked. For BNU, to lock com1:
                 at 38,400, you would use something like "L0=38400" on
                 BNU's command line.

             c.  If you lock the baud for one program, it must be
                 locked for everything. You can't lock the baud for just
                 this game, but not your BBS/mailer.

             d.  You may need to use the /B switch on the game.exe
                 Command line to specify the locked baud rate. For
                 19,200 this would be "/B19200" and for 38,400 this
                 would be "/B38400". Please note there is no space
                 between the "/B" and the baud rate.

        3.   What follows is some information on possible strange
             situations that may occur:

             a.  Low speed users can play the game, but high speed
                 users get garbage.
     
                 - If you are not using the DORINFOx.DEF or
                   DOOR.SYS drop file then you may wish to find a
                   converter program to convert whatever drop file
                   your BBS produces to the DORINFOx.DEF or DOOR.SYS
                   format and tell game.exe to use that.

                   Several converter programs are readily available
                   on most BBS systems. CallDoor is a good one if you
                   can find it. I have it on my BBS for download if
                   you need it.

             b.  The game hangs up when a user enters the game.

                 - Sounds like the game is getting the wrong baud
                   rate somehow. Try switching over to the DOOR.SYS
                   drop file method if possible.

             c.  Text and screens are getting cut off.

                 - If you are running with a locked baud, then this
                   could be caused by some sort of FLOW CONTROL
                   problem. Try using a fossil if you aren't already.

             d.  If you're using something other than the DOOR.SYS
                 drop file, then I always suggest trying to use
                 DOOR.SYS if possible. It is the most reliable method
                 and has had the most testing. If that is not possible
                 try DORINFOx.DEF as an alternative.

             e.  A door locks up node 1.  This can happen with fossils
                 or the internal communications routines because it
                 uses the default comport of 1 when NONE is found in
                 the dropfile or game.ctl file. To correct this make
                 sure the right port is shown in the dropfile OR
                 game.ctl file.

             f.  ANSI is reflected correctly on the local screen but
                 the user is getting garbage.  Assuming the user has
                 ANSI installed then most likely the problem is at
                 your end. First make sure you have configured the 
                 game.ctl file to show the correct locked port rate.
                 Second make sure the dropfile is passing the locked
                 port rate INSTEAD of the actual conncet rate.  If it
                 is not passing the locked port rate then you may
                 need to use a different dropfile format OR use a
                 dropfile converter program to change the line to
                 show the locked port rate INSTEAD of the actual
                 connect rate.

                            "Corrupted" data files
                             ----------------------
        It is possible that something could happen to your game
        data file.  A power outage, game crash, or other event could
        damage the data  files.  If you get  one of these messages,
        then the best thing to do is run the DEDIT.EXE program to
        reset the game.
