  1 - INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So cold steel and hot blood fills your every thought. The grand quest for
fame and fortune fuels your every movement. Does the gleam of gold, ill-gotten
or not, cloud your mind and feed your desires? If so, then enter a world where
your iron grip will allow you to forge your own destiny and one day become an
IMMORTAL!

Axe & Fang has been designed to be as true an RPG as you can get on a computer.
Many long hours of beta testing and re-coding have gone into AXE, in an
attempt to bring you the best fantasy RPG door game that you can ever lay
your paws on. Axe is by far the most flexible and interactive game on the
market. Featuring over 65 interactive multi-node commands. Built in monster,
object and room editors. The ability to load monsters and items on the spot.
It's simple and straight forward zone file allows for complete freedom in
building or editing worlds for AXE. On the spot quest generation for players
on multi-nodes can be made.

I hope you find AXE to be as fun to play as it was for me and the beta team to
build! Thanks for taking time to give AXE a test drive.

                              Author,
                              Charles Marchant

2 - INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Unpack all of AXE???.ZIP into the desired directory you wish it
        to run it in.

Step 2: Run INSTALL.BAT. The install batch file will create the directory
        tree and place all files into their desired places. It will then
        delete all files not required in the root directory.

Step 3: Create the config files for each node. This is as follows:

  Sample config file for node 1
  -----------------------------
  file name NODE1.CFG  <- Must be different for each node!

          c:\BBS\door.sys
          2
          Charles's Place
          Mr.Quick
          0
          1
          38400
          2


  Details of each line in config file
  -----------------------------------

         line 1  Path to drop file including name
         line 2  type of drop file 1 = DORINFOx.DEF 2 = DOOR.SYS 3 = CHAIN.TXT
         line 3  BBS name
         line 4  SysOp Name
         line 5  Port IRQ       ( 1 - 15 used only for internal com support )
         line 6  Port base address ( fossil/digi port 0 - 63 )
         line 7  Locked BPS Rate 0 = no lock
         line 8  Com support 1 = internal 2 = fossil 3 = digi-board

  Explanations of certain lines
  -----------------------------

  line 5: Line 5 is the irq line and can be numbered from 1 to 15.
          Irq is only used under internal com support. It can be
          any number under fossil or digi board support since it is
          ignored. It is suggested you make it 0 just to keep the
          config file easy to read.

  line 6: Line 6 is special and you must understand this line in order
          to get the game to function properly. Most if not all errors
          in running AXE are right here!

          Under Fossil or Digi-board support this is a number from 0
          to 63, this is the port you wish to run this node under.
          Fossil drivers begin numbering ports at 0 and not 1 so if
          you want to run on pc com1 then you must supply a 0 here.




                                        2







          quick ref:

          com1 = 0
          com2 = 1
          ...
          ...
          com8 = 7

          Under internal com support this is a hexadecimal number equal
          to the base address of the comport you wish to run the node
          under.

          quick ref:

          com1 =  3f8
          com2 =  2f8
          com3 =  3e8
          com4 =  2e8


  Step 4: Create a batch file to run the door.
          (Step 4 is subject to change at a later date)

          If your BBS has the ability to pass the node number on a
          command line then one batch file should work for all nodes.

          example:

          AXE.BAT

          cd doors\axe
          AXE node%1.cfg %1
          cd..
          cd..

          Then just call AXE.BAT with one argument which is the
          node number to run.

          If your system doesn't pass the node on the command line
          then a batch file for each node may be in order.

          example:

          AXE1.BAT

          cd doors\axe
          AXE NODE1.CFG 1
          cd..
          cd..

          AXE.EXE takes two command line arguments, the first is the
          path and name of the config file to use for that node and
          the second is the node number to run under.

  Step 5: Set up the door in your BBS.




                                        3





  Step 6: THIS IS A MUST!!! Be the first person to play.
          Understand this! THE FIRST PERSON IN THE GAME IS GOD!!!
          They are promoted to 25th level and give 99% in all skills!
          They have full access to the god commands and can really
          damage your game if they don't know what they are doing.
          AFTER INSTALL, ENTER THE GAME IN LOCAL MODE!!! I will not
          feel bad for any SysOp that doesn't do this! If you damage
          the world/mob/obj files it is your duty to replace them.
          I suggest keeping a backup of these files handy.

  Step 7: If you wish to play as a normal person in the game, then
          create another player. Only the first player into the
          game becomes god, and all others start at 1st level where
          the adventure begins! Then they can work their way up to become 
          a god also.


That's all there is to the installation of AXE. Simple and direct. If
you have any problems, feel free to call me. My number is listed in
the SysOp docs.

        *.*          Player item files stored under the first letter of
                     their name. Done this way to protect data and an
                     easy way for the SysOp to purge a players items they
                     believe were gotten in a rather sneaky manner.

   AXE\DOCS

   AXE\DATA

       MULTI.DAT    This is the node share file. If you ever see this file while
                    no nodes are running, then check your node setups for a
                    duplicate. If this file is present, then you have an error
                    somewhere and will surely get a share violation.

4 - MAINTENANCE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Axe & Fang requires no maintenance of any kind. All work is handled online in
real time as players adventure the world. Axe doesn't restrict players to any
time limit, other than that which is passed in the drop file. It doesn't care
if you log in 30 times a day at 30 mins a play, and it never will. People
wanting to limit plays must figure out another means of doing it. The reason is
rather simple, to maintain this data would add 4 bytes to every mob in the world
and is considered a waste of space when overall growth of the world needs all
the room it can get. Axe allows players to create as many characters as they
wish, for the like reason. To monitor user BBS names would require an addition
of 41 bytes per record. This is a total waste of memory where the overall
world is concerned.

5 - SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  To run Axe & Fang you need......

  Computer:    PC XT/AT IBM 100% compatible
  Memory  :    460 to 640k free
               Axe uses no XMS/EMS at all
  BBS S.W.:    Capable of producing DOOR.SYS, CHAIN.TXT or DORINFOx.DEF
               drop files.
  OS      :    Dos 3.2 or higher or a OS that can run DOS shells and
               use a FOSSIL driver
  Free Space : Axe needs about 4 megs free HD space. This grows on
               systems with more nodes.
  Share.exe  : If you are running under DOS you must have share
               loaded.

  Multi Taskers: Axe detects OS/2, WINDOWS, WINDOWS/NT and DESQVIEW.
                 Axe doesn't give up time slices for one reason,
                 there is never a delay in the program. The only
                 two delays in the program are at the login
                 screens. Axe is in real time and sets in no loops
                 waiting for character input and doing nothing.




































                                        8





6 - NOTE ON MULTI-NODES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Axe uses a signal file found in the .\DATA directory while games
  are in play. This file is called MULTI.DAT. This file is opened by the first
  node to begin play and is closed and deleted by the last node to exit play.
  This file can grow rather large on a big multi node system and it is
  highly recommended that at least once a day no play be allowed in the
  game on any nodes at the same time. If you run a nightly maintenance
  and wish to make sure the file is deleted by adding a line to your batch
  file, then be very sure there is no one in the door or you will get a
  share violation and lock your window.

  Further more, don't ever boot up two of the same nodes into axe at
  one time. Anything from a share violation to MULTI.DAT being left
  un-deleted can occur.

  Axe requires that full file sharing be in affect. LANS that lock
  resources from other running nodes, can not at this time run AXE in
  multi-node interaction. You can still run AXE on more than one node but will
  have to have more than one copy online for it to work properly.

  In DOS, share must be loaded.

9 - BEING A GOD IN AXE & FANG
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you want to be a god do you? Well here's the door for you! There is less
than 15% of AXE that is not SysOp editable or player editable. Since this is so,
it is very important to understand what being a god is all about. Let's start
by saying a god holds all the power in Axe. There is nothing he or she can not
change to improve the world for their users, or to better the enjoyment of the
game. Likewise, a god can so unbalance the game from sloppy editing as to make
it too easy or hard. If the game is too easy, then you end up with all gods, and
no peasants to punish. Too hard and no one will play the game after a while. To
keep the world even and challenging, then you must read and understand the
following sections before you begin to tailor AXE to your liking. One big word
of advice, backup the AXE directory before each editing session, that way if you
make a blunder, a recovery is near by.

10 - BUILDOBJ COMMAND
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build or edit an object (obj), you must be level 25. Type buildobj
and you will be prompted with the below:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                            |
| Hello Grim, while you are building a obj, the world here will pause.       |
| Highest obj in world = 155                                                 |
| Edit Obj  (0 - 154) New Obj  ( 155 ) :                                     |
|                                                                            |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To edit an old obj, enter it's number or else enter the number to the right of
new mob (155 in this case) to begin editing a new monster. Once done, you will
be prompted with a status window similar to the one below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXPLANATION OF COMMANDS
-----------------------

 A - Name            This command will first prompt you for the new name
                     of the object, then prompt you for a keyword. The key
                     word should be lower case and have meaning to the object,
                     or be part of the objects name.
                     
                     ex:
                        name      A blue steel key
                        keyword   key

 B - Type            This command allows you to select from a list of
                     available type types. See list below. This will
                     affect how the extra values are assigned.



                                        13





 C - Apply           This is a flag that is used to set a magical
                     affect applied to the player when worn, held or
                     wielded. After selecting an apply type, you will be
                     prompted for a value, then whether it is negative
                     or not.

 D - Value           This is the value of the item in gold. A 0 value
                     item can not be rented and is junked when a person
                     tries to buy or sell it.

 E - Weight          This is the weigh in pounds of the object. A players
                     strength determines the amount of weight that they can
                     handle for weapons etc.

 F - Cost to Rent    This is the amount in gold it cost a player to save an
                     object when they log out of the game using the rent
                     command at an inn.

 G - Spec Flag       Sets a visual flag like glowing, humming and others
                     that the item will have.

 H - Affect Flags    This is a set of flags that tells what type of affect
                     the item will have on a player when worn, held or
                     wielded.

 I - Extra Values    This is a set of 4 fields which are assigned values
                     depending on the type of item being built. Follow
                     the prompts and you should have no problem with
                     this section.

 W - Wear Flag       This is a set of flags that determine whether
                     a player can take an item and if so where it may be
                     worn, held or wielded.

 J - Save            Save the object to disk for later use by Axe.

 K - Abort           This command simply aborts the editor.

EXPLANATION OF COMMANDS
-----------------------

  A - Name        This is the name of the mob shown to players.
                  It is also the keyword when used in a players command.
                  It is wise not to start the name with 'A', 'The', etc,
                  since then a person must type kill the, kill a to and
                  so on.

  B - Abilities   A New NPC is set with a base ability score of 13's, if you
                  wish to change them, this command will step you through
                  each one and prompt for a new number. Abilities can go
                  between 4 and 25.
  C - Sex         This will prompt you for a sex of the mob, either neuter,
                  male or female.


                                        17





  D - Alignment   This will prompt you for the new alignment of the mob.
                  Alignment can range from -1000 ( max evil) to 1000
                  ( max good )

  E - ACT Flag    This is a special flag that tells the game how the mob
                  will act in the world. A description of actions follows
                  this section.

  F - Affect Flag This is a special flag which can be used to set starting
                  affects on a mob. A list of affects follows this section.

  G - Position    This command allows you to alter the starting position
                  of the mob. By default they are standing. Any other
                  position will not allow the mob to act according to
                  the act flag.

  H - Hit Points  This command will prompt you for the new hit points of the
                  mob. The norm is 12 to 20 points per level of the mob. The
                  higher the number, the harder it is to kill. If you make 
                  areas for ogre and troll barbarians to adventure in, then set 
                  the hit points high since these class/race combos do high
                  damage rolls.

  I - Move        Will prompt for the mobs new amount of move points.
                  The more move points a mob has, the more it can roam
                  the world or flee from combat.

  J - Mana        This command prompts for the new amount of mana the
                  mob will have. This affects the amount of times they can
                  employ special spell functions in combat.

  K - AC          This is the mobs starting ac, and can range from -100
                  to 100. Negative 100 is the best one can hope for and
                  100 is the worst.

  L - Hitroll     This is a mobs base chance to hit a player with ac 0.
                  The lower this number becomes the easier a mob hits.
                  The range can be from -20 to 20.

  M - Damroll     This is a mobs bonus to damage. Once all damage is
                  determined in combat this is added to it.

  N - Damage Dice This will prompt you for 3 numbers. The first is
                  the size of the dice to roll for damage, second is
                  the number of dice to roll and third is the bonus
                  to damage. For low level monsters keep damage small,
                  say from 1 to 6 max, the higher mobs get, the more you
                  can added to this. Setting this too high, will really
                  unbalance the game for players. Too low and players
                  will walk all over your world.

  O - Attack Type This sets the prompt that will be seen when the mob
                  attacks with bear hands. When used correctly, you can get
                  the affect of a mob using a weapon without having to
                  load one for them.

  P - Spec Class  This is a bit that sets the mobs special flag. What
                  the special class is used for is quite simple. There
                  are two main groups of special classes, shop and
                  guild. For a player to be able to buy or sell, a shop
                  flag must be set. For a player to practice, a guild
                  flag must be set. There are a number of each type used
                  to limit the types of items bought and sold and the
                  class that can practice with a certain mob.

  Q - Level       This set the mobs level, it can range from 1 to
                  25.

  R - Exp         This is the base value a mob is worth in exp when killed.
                  The amount shown is a seed amount used to figure earned
                  exp for the kill. Other factors play into the final
                  amount. Like the number of levels difference between
                  killer and killed. The alignments of each and a few other
                  small factors. See table below for suggested ranges
                  per level of mob.

  S - Gold        Gold is a special item for mobs. If you wish a shop keeper
                  to be able to purchase a large amount of items, they must
                  have gold. It's not suggested that you overload low level
                  mobs with gold since this is a major factor in the game.
                  Very high level and powerful weapons are all throughout
                  the game and are meant for high level players only.
                  The amount they cost to rent is high, if a low level
                  player can kill a worm for 10k gold, then they will be
                  able to keep a powerful weapon and walk all over your
                  world making it unbalanced. When a player like that
                  makes god, he or she will have no respect for how hard it
                  was to get there, and lend nothing to your world of a
                  positive nature.

  T - Save        This saves the edited mob.

  U - Abort       This aborts the edited mob.

  V - Description This takes you to a small editor where you may add in
                  a description for the mob or leave it to it's default.

                    in.

3 - Flags         : This command brings up a sub-list of possible flags to
                    turn on or off for the room. Flags may be joined to
                    build elaborate rooms.

4 - Light         : If set to light, the room has lighting on as default.
                    Leave it set to no, if its outside and you wish the

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                            |
| 0 - North                                                                  |
| 1 - East                                                                   |
| 2 - South                                                                  |
| 3 - West                                                                   |
| 4 - Up                                                                     |
| 5 - Down                                                                   |
| Edit which exit :                                                          |
|                                                                            |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Select a direction and you will then be prompted with a number of options
as follows.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                                                            |
|  To room = 0 ((null))                                                      |
|  New Room (N/y) :                                                          |
|                                                                            |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a 'To room' has already been selected the name of the room would follow
the room number. To room 0 closes an exit off.

If you answer Y, you will be prompted for the new room number for the exit
to go to. If you wish a player to be able to come back from the room which
the exit leads to, the then other rooms opposite exit must have the editing
rooms number there. ex:  Editing room 10 going north, the 'to room' is 11, then
room number 11's south exit must equal 10 to be a two way passage.

You can make one way passages by leaving the 'to rooms' opposite direction
blank or leading to another room all together.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to lock the room with a key of some kind, you would answer yes
to this prompt, then supply the key number for the exit. NOTE: The key number
is the extra value0 of a key items and not a key items real number.

Following the key prompt you will be given a keyword prompt like so.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you selected keyword besides 0 (door) you will need to set ISDOOR flag.
You can only set one flag at a time, so you will have to run back through the
exit setup and select additional flags as desired.

Explanations of exit flags:

OPEN         <- the exit starts out at boot up as open
CLOSED       <- the exits is closed at boot up
LOCKED       <- exit is locked at boot up
UNLOCKED     <- exit is not locked at boot up
MAGIC        <- takes a spell/rod/staff/wand/potion to pass this door
PICKPROOF    <- door can never be picked by a thief, etc.
ISDOOR       <- means the exit is open and closable, must be set
                for exits with other than 0 for a keyword

NOTE: To make an exit usable for players while working on a area just
      set the to_room to 0, you don't have to remove any other options
      from the exit.

13 - MLOAD COMMAND
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This command is a very powerful god command, and can be used in the making
 of quest. It loads a mob into the world at the same location as the god.
 Since a lot of the mobs are aggressive it is wise to be in a god room,
 rooms 0 to 9, when this is done. Then use the trans command to move the
 mob to the desired location. Special mobs can be made and loaded into the
 world without ever taking down the game. You can use the buildmob command
 to make a special mob for a quest then load it right away using mload.
 Mload takes one command argument and that is the record number of the
 mob to load into the world.

14 - OLOAD COMMAND
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Oload is a powerful god command used to load objects into the world. The
 loaded object is dropped on the ground at the gods feet. This command along
 with mload, buildmob, buildobj, can all be used in the making of quest.
 Oload takes one command argument and that is the record number of the object
 to load.

15 - THE ZONE FILE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The zone file is in truth, the heart of Axe. It's what links all the mob, obj
and room files together. The zone file controls what mobs are loading into
what room, what objs are loaded into rooms, given to mobs or even
equipped by the mobs. The zone file is a simple ASCII text file and follows
this simple layout.

# is used to comment a complete line
M is used to load a mob
O is used to load a obj
G is used to give the last loaded obj to the last loaded mob
E is used to give the last loaded obj to the last loaded mob
  and have them equip it.
$ is placed at the end of the zone file, once $ is found the
  zone file is closed and zone loading is done. The $ must be
  in the file at some point, normally the end.

Zone file command syntax
------------------------

M <mob number> <room number>
O <obj number> <room number>
G
E <location to equip>
$

Sample zone file
----------------

#--------------------------------
# Area 1
#--------------------------------

M 1 100         <--- Load mob 1 to room 100
O 1 100         <--- load obj 1 to room 100
G               <--- Give to mob
O 2 100         <--- load obj 2 to room 100
E 16            <--- give to mob and wield as weapon

#--------------------------------
# End area 1
#--------------------------------
$               <--- End of zone file

16 - QUEST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Through the use of the editor commands, oload and mload, a god can make
 on the fly quest.  This is really only good for multi-node systems but can
 be a real blast if done right.

example:

 Say you have 10 lines and 5 players are in the game, all 6th to 15th level.
 You could enter the game as god, edit a quick wicked item for a prize,
 then load up a few aggressive monsters into Tooth to invade it. Have
 the players defend Tooth and those that survive get one of the nice
 items you built for a prize.

 Or another idea is to hide a item somewhere in the world and let the
 players search for it. You could also request a item known to be in
 the world, and the first player that brings it to you wins the quest.

 Likewise you can load a nasty mob somewhere in the world and let the
 players attempt to find it and kill it.

 Basically quest are wide open, you can be as colorful as you want, or not
 have any at all, it's up to you.

17 - DAMAGED ITEM FILES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Damaged Item files are for the most part very easy to recover from. If a
player for some reason ends up with a corrupted file follow these few steps.

1) Delete his/her item file. This can be found in the \player\A to Z
   directories. Look in the directory were the letter is the same as the
   first letter of the players name. The item file will be named
   part of ( all if the names shorter than 8 letter) the players
   name. The extension is a number which is equal to the record number
   of the player.

2) If on a multi node system, then you enter on one node as god and have the
   user enter the game on another node. Then just use oload to give the
   player back any items he lost due to the corruption. Then just have him
   or her rent.

3) If on a single node system then deleting is about the best you can do.

NOTE: In truth you can just preform step two and have the player drop all
      before you begin to give him back the items lost.
