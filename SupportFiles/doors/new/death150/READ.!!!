File:  READ.!!!

If you are upgrading from a previous version, when you unpack the
file DEATH.ZIP (or DEATH.ARJ), you might notice a few "Can't create file"
errors.  Do not worry about them.  You already have those files marked
as read only on your hard disk.

To Upgrade, just unzip over the current game and type "SETUP".  If you are
upgrading from v1.02 or below, you need to RESET the game using "SETUP."
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Version 1.50 fixes the last known bugs of the game, including a memory leak
when posting public announcements, a bug found at the bank, the mistake I
made on leaving the -CFG parameter unsupported in v1.40, etc.
A new option called "[B]lind enemies spell" has been added to the level
Master's menu.  Also, 2 more levels have been coded so the game now ends at
level 18.  Five more weapons where added in the process.

Finally, the files DMBBS_AD.ANS and DMBBS_AD.ASC have been added to help you
advertise the game to your users, as well as the file CATALOG.EXE has been
added to the package so you can see what's available from RPG2100 DoorWare.

Enjoy!
