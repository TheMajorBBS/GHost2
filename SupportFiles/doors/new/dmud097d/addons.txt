DOORMUD PROFESSIONAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   DoorMUD Professional is intended for larger boards with VERY active DoorMUD
   games.  It adds the following features to DoorMUD:
 
   - Increases the max user count to 16 users, meaning that 16 people can play
     DoorMUD at the same time on your BBS.  (Please note that hardware and
     memory restrictions may effectively reduce this number on some systems,
     especially when using the DOS version of DoorMUD)

   - Adds a sysop option to customize DoorMUD's experience point tables.  This
     allows you to control how quickly players can gain levels.  Higher 
     experience table settings make the game much more playable with higher 
     Monster Fight settings.

   - Adds an optional "hard" difficulty mode that makes DoorMUD more
     challenging.  When in "hard" mode, monsters have more hitpoints, more
     damaging attacks, and respawn at a faster rate; resting players heal
     hitpoints more slowly; gold is slightly more scarce; and fewer areas are
     level-restricted.  These changes make DoorMUD more difficult on larger 
     boards, where players frequently join up in groups to defeat monsters.

   - Adds a sysop option to configure the level range for player-vs-player
     combat, or disable it entirely if desired.

   Most smaller hobbyist boards will NOT need DoorMUD Professional.  You will
   probably only need this add-on if you want to run a MUD-oriented BBS where
   DoorMUD is frequently in use by many players at the same time.  

   DoorMUD Professional is marketed as an *add-on*, meaning that you *must*
   also have a basic DoorMUD registration in order to use it.  DoorMUD
   Professional costs $40 US.  Remember, if you wish to buy DoorMUD
   Professional but you do not already have a basic registration, you should
   order both at the same time for $60 US ($20 for basic registration and $40
   for DoorMUD Professional).



DOORMUD WORLD EDITOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This product will allow you, the sysop, to edit and add to the DoorMUD game
   world through use of special implementor commands. Almost any aspect of the
   game can be edited -- players, monsters, rooms, items, spells, quests, and 
   more. You can even assign other trusted users of your BBS to be 
   implementors as well.

   The DoorMUD World Editor is still under development and is not yet
   available for download.  When it is released, it will be free for registered
   sysops.
