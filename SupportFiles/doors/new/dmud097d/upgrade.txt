Upgrading from a previous version of Windows DoorMUD to the current one
=======================================================================
If you already have a previous *Windows* version of DoorMUD installed on your
system, simply unzip the new archive to your existing DoorMUD directory,
overwriting all older files.

To see what has changed in this version of DoorMUD, hit R at the DoorMUD
entrance menu to view the full release notes.


Upgrading from the DOS version of DoorMUD to the Windows version
================================================================
(You only ever have to do this once!)

If you already have the *DOS* doorgame version of DoorMUD on your system, but
want to upgrade to the Win32 version, perform the following steps:

      1. Backup all of your DoorMUD files to another directory (or possibly to
         a zip file).  This is just as a precaution, in case you have problems
         with the Windows version of DoorMUD.  

      2. Unzip the archive to your existing DoorMUD directory, overwriting older
         files.  (Don't worry, the current player file won't be erased)

      3. Change the command line your BBS uses to call DoorMUD according to the
         instructions found in DoorMUD's README.TXT (of the new door32 version),
         section 3, step 2.

Sysop display window:
  By default, the Door32 version of DoorMUD provides an interactive graphical
  display window on your computer whenever one of your users is in DoorMUD.
  This window allows you to monitor the user, as well as perform sysop actions
  such as hang-up, increase/decrease time left, chat mode, etc.  Unless you are
  running DoorMUD in local mode, this window automatically starts minimized.
  If desired, you can eliminate this window entirely using the -silent command
  line option (ie, dmud32d -n # -d XXX -silent).
