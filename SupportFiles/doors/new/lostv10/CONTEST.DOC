      Announcing first (Hopefully not the last) Lost Temple Contest!


    The following contest is open to anyone that plays The Lost Temple. 


Prizes:

   The winner will receive the computer version of the RPG of his/her
   choice. (Up to a $75 value)

How To Win:

   The first player to find the white rune in The Lost Temple V1.0 will
   be declared the winner.  It is up to the player or the sysop running
   the system to contact the authors about possible winners.  If you are
   a user, ask your sysop about where the authors can be contacted.

   Once we have been notified, we will call the system that the winner plays
   on and verify the players data files.  If the files are legitimate,
   then that player will be crowned the winner.  

   Investigations of winning players will be done in the order that 
   notifications are received.


BONUS:

   If the player declared the winner, wins on a system that was one of the
   first 20 systems to register The Lost Temple V1.0, then that player will
   also receive a cluebook (if available) for the game he selects as his
   prize.  In addition, the sysop of that system will also get a copy of
   the game of his/her choice and a cluebook.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Decisions of the authors are final.  Possible winners will be investigated
   in the order that we receive the notifications.
