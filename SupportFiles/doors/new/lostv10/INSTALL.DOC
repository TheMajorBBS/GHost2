Lost Temple Installation
------------------------

If you are updating from a previous version, you may skip this part of the 
documentation and just read the "update" section of this file.

To install The Lost Temple on your system, simply create the directory 
where you want the game to reside and copy INSTALL.BAT and LOST.EXE 
into that directory.  Run the install batch file and the game will extract
itself and create all necessary directories.  Once installation is finished
create a batch file to load the game similar to the following:

CD C:\BBS\TEMPLE
COPY C:\BBS\DOOR.SYS
TEMPLE
CD C:\BBS

This game uses no command line switches or configuration files, it will 
take all information it needs from the DOOR.SYS or DORINFO1.DEF dropfiles.  
The game will automatically detect which file is present and read it in.
Please be sure that you copy the dropfile into the game's root directory
before you run the door!


Updating The Lost Temple
------------------------

To update a previous version of The Lost Temple, copy the Lost.EXE file
and the UPDATE.BAT file into your game's root directory.  Then just run
the update.bat file.  Any new files will be added and old files will be
overwritten automatically.


Maintenance
-----------

  The Lost Temple requires no maintenance.  Once it is installed on your 
system you will most likely not have to touch it again.  Everything is
kept track of as the game is played, there's no need for daily maintenance
by the game, or by you.
