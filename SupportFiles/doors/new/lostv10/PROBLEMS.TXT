Several changes have been made in the way The Lost Temple handles files for
version 1.0.  Because of this, some players will unfortunately be reset.

V0.2 and V0.3 saved the players filenames exactly as the players handles
appeared. This means that certain files were created by the game with
spaces in the file names such as "JOE BLOW.PLY".  I didn't realize that
these file names would interefere with certain maintenance functions such
as drive de-fragment programs.  Version 1.0 will now strip spaces and 
periods from the players handles and save the file names correctly.  Players
that had no spaces in their names will not be effected, but others will
have to start over.

If you are having trouble getting rid of old files that contained spaces in
the file names, you can do 2 things.  I've found that the PC-Tools programs
will handle these file without a problem.  You can delete them with 
PC-Tools.  If you can not locate a copy of PC-Tools or some other drive
maintenace utility that can handle these files, you can delete *.* in the
players directory and it will get rid of the files for you, but of course,
this means that all players on your system will have to start over.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused, but the changes were 
necessary.

If you encounter any other problems with V1.0 you can contact me through
