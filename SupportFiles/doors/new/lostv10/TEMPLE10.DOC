The following text is a listing and explanation of most of the
commands found in The Lost Temple V1.0.  Please bear in mind that I
am a programmer, not a writer.  Therefore this file may be a bit
disorganized and will probably have a few thing accidentally
omitted.  Other than that, I hope this will help you out a bit with
the game.  It should suffice as a reference if you'd care to print
it out.


Game Overview
-------------

    The Lost Temple is your basic role playing game.  When you enter
the game for the first time you will be asked to pick a race and
class for your character. (Races and classes are explained within the
game.) Once your character is generated, you will begin your journey
through the fantasy world contained within the game.  Your main goal
is to locate and free the lost temple.   To accomplish this you will
have to advance levels and find several runes located in hidden
areas throughout the game map.
    You will most likely want to begin making maps of the game's
different areas.  You might also want to ask your sysop to set aside
a message base for Lost Temple players.  You'll find the game a bit
easier if you can trade information with other players.  There's
plenty of hidden stuff in the game, someone else might find
something that you walked right past and vice versa.

Game Commands
-------------

Attack       -  This command will work in any area where there is a
                monster present.  I think it's rather self explanatory.

Buy <item>   -  This command will allow you to buy items from
                shopkeepers.  You must, of course, have room in your
                inventory and have sufficient gold.

Buy Level    -  This command works only in the training guild.  When
                your character has reached the proper amount of
                experience points, you will be allowed to advance to the
                next level.  You must also have enough gold to pay for
                your training.

Cast <spell> -  This command will work in any area for spellcasters.
                Offensive spells will only work when a monster is
                present.  Defensive spells, such as acolytes healing
                spells will work at any time as long as the player has
                enough mana to cast the spell.

Drink <item> -  This command will make your character drink an item
                in your current inventory.

Exits        -  This command will display all visible exits from the
                room you are currently in.  (Beware, not all exits are
                visible)

Get <item>   -  This command will make your character pick up any item
                that you may find on the ground.  You must have room in
                your inventory.

Health       -  This command will show your character's current health
                information.  (May be abbreviated as "HE")

Help         -  This command will give you a short menu of help topics
                currently available to players.

Inventory    -  This will display how much gold you currently have as
                well as the items you are currently carrying.
                Characters may hold up to 8 items.

List         -  This command will work in any shop.  Use it to get a
                listing of all items the shop sells as well as their
                prices.

List Acolyte -  This command works only in the training guild.  It will
                display a list of spells available to acolytes as well
                as their cost and how much mana they use when cast.

List Druid   -  Same as above, but lists druid spells.

List Sorcerer-  Same as above, but lists sorcerer spells.

Look         -  This command will show you a brief description of any
                monster in the room with you, as well as give you a hint
                as to the monster's physical condition.

Quit         -  This command will save your character and return you to
                the BBS.

Reroll       -  This command will allow you to get a new set of stats
                for your character.  Current race and class are kept in
                tact.

Sell <item>  -  This will allow you to sell items to the shopkeepers.
                You must be in the proper shop to sell an item. Ex. The
                armor shop will not buy magical items.

Spells       -  This command works only for spellcasters.  It will
                display the spells currently contained within your
                spellbook.

Status       -  This command will show your character's current
                statistics. (May be abbreviated as "ST")

Suicide      -  This command will kill your character and the next time
                you enter the game you will be prompted to choose a new
                class and race.

Use <item>   -  This command will use an item in your current inventory.
                Not all items work with the use command.

When dealing with potions, you will only have to enter the color of the
potion you wish to buy, sell or drink.  For example, type "Buy Red" and
not "Buy Red Potion".

To move through the rooms simply type the direction you wish to move.
Directional commands may be typed out in whole words or abbreviated such
as "N" or "SW".

You may also abbreviate some of the commonly used, single word commands
such as "Attack" and "look" by typing only the first letter of the
command.
