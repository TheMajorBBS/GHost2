ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

   You want to get in contact with me, Devon Brooks, The Author?  GREAT!

   I simply *LOVE* receiving messages!  (Really, I do!)

   Here are some of the most convenient ways of contacting me:

   1. FidoNet EchoMail Message Areas.  I frequently read the DOORGAMES Echo
      and the ON_LINE_GAMES Echo.

      Hopefully soon, there will be a ROK echo available on Plannet Connect.
      If this becomes available, I will, of course, answer messages in here as
      well, since it *IS* an entire echo devoted to my game. :-)

      Since I receive a LOT of messages every day, chances are you won't get
      a reply back very quickly.   It usually takes me 1-2 days to answer my
      mail completely.   Depending on where you live, please allow 5-10 days
      for a reply to come back to you. It's also in here that I announce new
      releases of ROK, so keep up in these echos, and you'll be kept informed!

   2. Netmail.  My FidoNet Netmail Address is 1;140/129.

      It doesn't matter if you route the Netmail message or crash it to me.
      In most cases, I will route the reply back to you, but sometimes, if it
      is urgent, I will crash it back to you.  I usually answer my Netmail
      messages as soon as I can, so this might be the best method of getting
      in contact with me.

   3. Internet E-Mail.  My Internet Address is "bfs@sk.sympatico.ca",
      without the quotes ("").

      I usually check my Mail on the Internet about every 2 days.  However,
      that does not mean you will get a reply in 2 days.  It will most likely
      take about 4 days for me to reply to your message on here.  Depending
      on the urgency of the message, though, I could reply back right away.

   4. Voice Support!  My Voice Phone Number is 1-306-692-7374.  Please call
      between 6pm and 9pm Central Standard Time (CST).  Please check *YOUR*
      time zone, then check the difference of time between yours and mine,
      THEN decide when to call.  What I mean is that if you are two hours
      behind me, then call between 4pm and 7pm in your area, since that is
      the equivalent to 6pm and 9pm in my area.  Does that make sense?  Hope
      so.  There's nothing worse, in my opinion, than receiving a voice call
      when I'm supposed to be sleeping! :-)

      Voice support is probably the quickest method of contacting me.  It's
      person-to-person, so that your questions are answered directly by me.

      In case you didn't know, I am 16 years old.  Thus, I might not be home
      sometimes, and my parents might answer.  If that is the case, simply
      tell them that you will call back another time, and hopefully I will be
      home at that time.  To make your life a bit easier, I have tennis league
      nights on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday all this summer, so try not to
      call those nights.

      When I answer the phone, please notify me that you are calling for ROK
      assistance.  Otherwise, I might think you are a friend of mine calling
      me up, and I won't treat you with the courteousness I should. :-)

   5. The Author's BBS.  My BBS is "The Inner City BBS".  The Phone Number is
      1-306-694-5864.  This BBS is open 24 hours/day, 7 days a week.  Your 1st
      call will simply be a verification call; after I've updated your access
      level, you will have full access to the BBS.  Sorry I don't allow full
      access on first call, but I've got a lot of "troublesome" users in my
      area who like to abuse full-access-upon-first-call BBS's.

      The verification call will take less than two minutes, tops.  Simply
      call back the next day, or even later in the day, and you will have
      normal access.  I usually check the BBS every 2-4 hours, so it won't
      take that long to verify you.

      If you leave me a message in a local area on my BBS, I will usually
      reply to it within 2-4 hours of seeing it.  This is a quick method of
      getting a reply.  There is a specific message area setup JUST for ROK
      comments/suggestions/bug reports.  That is Message Area #2 on my BBS.
      If you wish to write me a message on my BBS, this is the area to do it
      in.  However, if you want it to be a private message, there's always
      the local message area as well.  Doesn't matter to me at all.

   6. The *Official* Blazing Fire Software Web Site.

      The WWW address is: Http://www.sasknet.com/~bfs

      If you don't know how to make the "~", it's the top left hand key on
      the Keyboard, plus the Shift Button.  :-)  Some people ask me how to
      make it.  I call it a "Squiggley".

      On this WWW Site, you can always find the latest version of ROK here.
      You can also see upcoming programs from Blazing Fire Software, info
      regarding new upcoming releases of ROK, and E-Mail Devon Brooks, The
      Author, directly from this site!

      This WWW site was created and is maintained by Devon Brooks.

   7. Almost as a last resort:

      Mail.  Plain, ordinary "Snail" Mail.  My address is:

      Devon Brooks
      c/o 834 Ninth Avenue North West
      Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan
      Canada
      S6H - 4J1

      This is also the address to send Registration Forms.  If you specify
      an alternative way to reply besides Snail Mail, I will reply in that
      form. Otherwise, you will receive a reply in the mail 2-4 weeks after
      you sent it, depending on where you live.

   I *LOVE* receiving messages from people.  If you have a question, comment,
   suggestion, bug report, even if you just want to start a conversation - let
   me know about it! :-)
