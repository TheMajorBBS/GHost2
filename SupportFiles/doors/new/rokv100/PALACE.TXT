   `%Chancellor Robbins whispers:
   `0"I miss Lord Darok.  Was his death really natural, I wonder?"
   `%Kingdom Soldier says:
   `0"I'd like to think so, but rumours run rampant around here..."
   `%Baroness yells:
   `0"Rumours?  What rumours?  Please explain yourself, Soldier."
   `%Kingdom Soldier whispers:
   `0"I've said too much already.  Please forget what I've told you."
   `%Baroness laughs:
   `0"Isn't anyone going to say ANYTHING about Darok's death?"
   `%Chancellor Robbins yells:
   `0"I believe the King should hire more Soldiers into the Army..."
