  Realm of Kisom is a Multi-Player, Mutil-Node, Real-Time FRPG BBS DoorGame
  for use with Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).   We'll call it ROK for short.

   The idea of a Kingdom complete with all of it's background, history, and
   resources first came to me around Christmas of '95 when I was explaining
   to my parents, aunts, and uncles how I create and market computer games.
   When asked what I was going to do next for my game, I said I didn't know
   what I was going to do.   The suggestion came up for a Real-Time fantasy
   Kingdom with a background, history, storyline, multiple game outcomes, &
   multiple possible scenarios.  I went on from there.  Dubbed the Realm Of
   Kisom this game comes packed all that you SHOULD expect from a DoorGame.
   I have tried very hard to make this game simply the *BEST* in Fantasy RP
   Game's for BBS's. I am *VERY* proud of the work that I have done on ROK.

   Thought maybe you'd like to know how I came up with the game idea. :-)

   Configuring Realm of Kisom, in my opinion, is as easy as 1-2-3, but,
   I will explain it as best as I can should you need any assistance.

   If ROKCFG.EXE is being run for the first time, or the ROK.DAT doesn't
   exist, then you will be presented with the following screen:

   ** ERROR READING THE ROK.DAT FILE **

   Since this is the first version of Realm of Kisom, this will undoubtedly
   be the first time you've run this game.   Thus, simply select Choice (1)
   to begin the installation procedure.

 û (1) Create a new ROK.DAT file using the default variables
   (2) Skip the installation of Realm of Kisom and quit to DOS

   You have two choices (1 or 2).  Since this is the first time you are
   running ROKCFG.EXE, press 1, or Enter.    In almost every ROKCFG.EXE
   Menu, the "û" (checkmark) exists beside each option. Pressing UP Key
   or DOWN Key will move this checkmark up or down between the available
   options.  Pressing Enter on the option that the checkmark is on will
   invoke that option just as if you had hit the key in the () brackets.
   This makes it simpler for you to choose the options you want instead
   of searching for the correct keys to press.

   After you choose Selection 1, the following line will appear:

   ROK.DAT has been created using the default variables set by the author.

   This is basically self explanatory, but in short, it means that the
   ROK Global Variable File (ROK.DAT) has been created using the default
   values that the author has implemented.  These vars are configurable.

   After a key press, the following screen will appear:

   ** Realm of Kisom Configuration V1.00  **

   (M)iscellaneous Maintenance

   (Q)uit ROK Config & Save Changes

   An explanation of each option (briefly):

   (G)ame Options    - Allows you to change various settings in the game.
   (S)etup Node(s)   - Configure all of your BBS nodes (lines).  This is
                       where you define your drop file, com port, etc...
   (M)isc Maintenance- This menu is where the SysOp can perform various
                       functions that affect the game.
   (R)OK Editors Menu- This is the menu where you can edit various records
                       in the game.  Currently, these editors include:
                       Player, Monster, Level, Conversation, Atma, and the
                       Inn of Casimonda.  All editors are fully functional.
                       However, if you're running an unregistered version,
                       and changes you make will not be saved.
   (E)nter ROK Codes - When you register your copy of Realm of Kisom, you
                       will receive three lines of code completely unique
                       to your SysOp & BBS Name. This where you enter these
                       codes to register your copy of Realm of Kisom.
   (Q)uit ROKCFG.EXE - This will save any changes you've made while in
                       ROKCFG.EXE (except for the editors if you are
                       running an unregistered version), and exit the
                       program completely.

   In chronological order, I will do my best to explain each option.

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   (G)ame Options (Editable) explained:

   The following screen will appear upon entering this option:

   ** Realm of Kisom Configuration Version 1.00  - Game Options **

 û (1) Multi-Node Capability Support is xx.
   (2) Standard Number of Field Fights given daily is xx.
   (3) Standard Number of Player Fights given daily is xx.
   (4) CleanMode Support (Turn ON to remove "mature" parts) is xx.
   (5) Support to Transfer Funds between Bank Accounts is xx.
   (6) Max Gold available to transfer between Bank Accounts is xx.
   (7) Number of times a player can transfer funds per day is xx.
   (8) Support for players to Commit Suicide is xx.
   (9) Days users will have to wait to play again after suicide is xx.
   (0) Support for players to take weapons after a player victory is xx.

   (R) Reset the current Realm of Kisom game COMPLETELY.

   (Q) Quit to Main ROK Configuration Menu

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (1) Multi-Node Capability Support is (ON/OFF).

   Toggling this option between ON or OFF will set the Multi-Node
   Capabiltiies in ROK ON or OFF.  Setting this to ON will enable
   Multi-Node Real-Time Online Battles between two persons who're
   in the game at the same time battling each other.  Set this to
   OFF if you run a single node system.   If you have two or more
   nodes that run on your BBS, set this to ON.

   (2) Standard Number of Field Fights given daily is (xx).

   (xx) stands for any given number.  If it is an unregistered version,
   this value will be 15.  You cannot change this option until you have
   registered your copy of Realm of Kisom.  If you have registered, you
   may change this to anything you like. However, a desirable amount of
   fights is somewhere between 15-40. 40 is a bit high, but if you want
   a game where players can advance quickly, this is about as high as I
   would set the value.

   (3) Standard Number of Player Fights given daily is (xx).

   (xx) stands for any given number.  This is the same as Option (2) in
   the same menu, but is for the number of times a player can challenge
   another player in one day.  3 is the value set by the author, and if
   it is an unregistered version, you cannot change this value.  If you
   have registered, you may change this value to whatever you wish.   A
   desirable amount is between 3-5, since attacking other players let's
   players gain experience quickly - thus advancing them further in the
   game faster.

   (4) CleanMode Support (Turn ON to remove "mature" parts) is (ON/OFF).

   Recently, Bill Clinton, President of the United States of America,
   passed a bill known as the TeleCommunications Decency Act - or TDA
   for short.  In short, this means that if you abide by the law, you
   must set this to ON - which removes the more "mature" parts in the
   game.   I do not live in USA, I live in Canada, so I don't have to
   abide by this law. However, since a large majority of my customers
   are from USA, this option is needed.

   What exactly is disabled when this is toggled to ON?  Players cannot
   flirt with NPC's (Non-Playing Characters).    Male players can flirt
   with Hope and females can flirt with Logan when CleanMode is toggled
   to OFF.   If this is turned ON, no players at all can flirt with any
   NPC in the game.  Also, when flirting with other human characters in
   the game players cannot ask if they wish to meet in a bedroom in the
   Inn of Casimonda for a "adult" encounter.

   (5) Support to Transfer Funds between Bank Accounts is (ON/OFF).

   In many cases, where a player is ready to challenge Sakar Kane and
   restart his character afterwards, he/she will want to have someone
   else have some money for them to save for he/she for after his/her
   character gets reset.     Should this other "accomplice" decide to
   give the money back after that character is reset - that character
   would now have a definite head start in the game.    Having a vast
   amount of money at the start of the game would let a player level-
   up much quicker than any other player, thus unbalancing the entire
   game. If you dislike the idea of players abusing this option, then
   set this option to OFF.

   (6) Max Gold available to transfer between Bank Accounts is (xx).

   (xx) stands for any given number.  If Option 5 in the same menu is
   toggled to an ON setting, then you can set the amount of gold that
   can be transfered between the players.  An ON setting in Option 5,
   mixed with the correct amount value creates a usable option within
   the game without the possibilty of unbalance. (Explained in Option
   (5) of this menu)

   (7) Number of times a player can transfer funds per day is (xx).

   (xx) stands for any given number.  If Option 5 in the same menu is
   toggled to an ON setting, then you can set the number of times per
   day a player can transfer funds from their bank account to another
   player's account. The default value set by the author is $150,000,
   but you may change this to whatever you wish, even in unregistered
   versions.  Do not set this too high, though, as it will definitely
   unbalance the game very quickly when players start abusing it.

   (8) Support for players to Commit Suicide is xx.

   Somewhere within the Realm (HINT: Press "*" from Main Street), players
   can find Acro, a person who is willing to assist in suicide.  Basically,
   this is a Toggle for the SysOp to Enable/Disable the ability for players
   to commit suicide if they wish to do so.

   (9) Days users will have to wait to play again after suicide is xx.

   From what I have heard from other SysOp's, some users will create a player,
   do stupid things in the game, then commit suicide, repeat, etc. This is the
   reason for this option.   It will check to see if the username as committed
   suicide then check to see if s/he has waited the required days before a new
   character can be created.  Basically, it's to make the SysOp's life easier.

   (0) Support for players to take weapons after a player victory is xx.

   Many players have asked for a feature to steal the opponents weapon after
   s/he has won in a player battle against another player.    Likewise, many
   SysOp's do not like this in the game. Thus, I've implemented it - to suit
   the requests of many players.   And, I've created this toggle for SysOp's
   who dislike weapon-stealing in their games to disable it.  Fullfills both
   suggestions - the best of both worlds! :-)

   (R) Reset the current Realm of Kisom game COMPLETELY.

   This option is also pretty self explanatory.  If your player file
   has somehow become corrupted - or you wish to start a new game of
   Realm Of Kisom, simply use this option. Basically, the only thing
   this option does is delete the file called PLAYER.DAT which holds
   every player's record in ROK.    Deleting this file manually will
   also reset the current ROK Game.  This option will also reset the
   Chat Files (ROKINN.TXT, REBEL.TXT, & PALACE.TXT), & set the Guild
   Spells back to normal (not available to be learned).

   You will be prompted to input a Yes/No answer to check if you are
   absolutely sure you wish to reset the game, so you do not have to
   worry if you accidentally hit the (R) key.

   (Q) Quit to Main ROK Configuration Menu

   This option will save any changes you've made while in the Game
   Options menu, and return to the Main Configuration Menu.

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   (S)etup Node(s) for BBS's explained:

   The following screen will appear upon entering this option:

   ** Realm of Kisom Version 1.00  - Node #(x) Setup **

 û (1) BBS System Name   : (Name)
   (2) BBS Software Type : (Type)
   (4) Com Routines      : (Type)
   (5) Com Port Number   : (Port)

   ([) Move Back a Node  (]) Move Forward a Node  (Q)uit to Menu

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (1) BBS System Name.

   This option is where you define your BBS Name.  This can be any
   length, and it is not case sensitive.  This is also compared to
   your SysOp Name and your ROK Registration code to see if it's a
   valid code.  If you do not define your BBS Name here, it really
   doesn't matter - though it wouldn't hurt to take that few extra
   seconds to type it in here your BBS Name must be entered in the
   (E)nter Registration Codes menu from the Main Config. Menu when
   entering your Registration Codes.

   (2) BBS Software Type.

   This option is where you define your BBS Software Type, thus,
   also defining your Drop File Type.   Supported Drop Files for
   Realm of Kisom is the following:

       DOORSYS  - The DOOR.SYS format (Wildcat!,GAP,TAG, etc)
       DORINFO1 - Remote Access,others(uses DORINFO1.DEF)
       RBBS     - Rbbs version 16.1+  (uses DORINFOx.DEF)
       QUICK    - Quickbbs,Force,R.A. (uses DORINFOx.DEF)
       PCB14    - Pcboard version 14
       PCB15    - Pcboard version 15
       PHOENIX  - Phoenix bbs (uses INFO.BBS)
       SPITFIRE - Spitfires bbs (uses SFDOORS.DAT)
       WWIV     - WWIV bbs (uses CHAIN.TXT)
       TRIBBS   - TriBBS software (uses TRIBBS.SYS)
       2AM      - JUMPER.DAT

   To my knowledge, almost every BBS Software Type can run ROK on their
   system. If your BBS Type is not listed in the above list try setting
   this to DOORSYS or DORINFO1.  If neither of these work, consult your
   BBS Documentation for information on their specific drop file type &
   try again from there with the correct information.

   (3) Com Routines.

   There are four different types of Communications Routines supported by
   Realm of Kisom.   These are: Fossil, XFossil, DigiBoard, and Internal.

   An explanation of each type (they can be confusing!):

   (1) Fossil Driver: This is the standard setting for most BBS's.  If
                      you have problems with the com routine's in ROK,
                      and you have this option configured to something
                      other than FOSSIL try setting this to FOSSIL and
                      see how it works then.

                      Just what does FOSSIL do?  In short, FOSSIL will
                      initialize the detected FOSSIL that is loaded at
                      the time.  This means that it will reset the BNU
                      or SIO.SYS (or whatever you're running) and then
                      proceed with the game.   If an error is given at
                      this point - then I suggest changing to Internal
                      DDPlus Com Routines and it should work perfectly.

                      I have never ran a BBS under Windows 3.x or 95,
                      but from what I have heard, if you're running a
                      BBS under a DOS Window, or a straight DOS-Based
                      BBS, I recommend BNU Fossil Driver.  If you are
                      running your BBS under OS/2 I recommend SIO.SYS
                      made by Ray Gwinn.

   (2) XFossil      : XFossil is nearly the same as FOSSIL, but with one
                      difference. XFossil will NOT Initialize the FOSSIL
                      that is loaded at that present time.    This means
                      that when the detected FOSSIL is loaded - it won't
                      re-initialize it at all. This type is rarely used,
                      but if nothing else works, try this one.

   (3) Internal Com : This option is used for Internal DDPlus Com Routines.
                      DDPlus is the DoorDriver used with Realm of Kisom, so
                      this option should work perfectly fine for you.  When
                      FOSSIL is used sometimes there will be an error given
                      similar to this:

                      "FOSSIL was not initialized properly!  You should
                      change it to INTERNAL Com Routines."

                      If you get this error, change it to the Internal Com
                      Routines and see if it works. Since DDPlus is almost
                      part of the entire ROK Game, this FOSSIL Type should
                      have no problems whatsoever.

   (4) Com Port Number.

   This is where you can define the Com Port that your modem is connected
   to. If your BBS passes the Com Port to the drop file it creates (check
   your BBS Software Documentation), then you need not have to define it.

   ([) Move Back A Node.  (]) Move Forward A Node.

   Each node created makes a NODE*.DAT in your ROK Directory, where *
   is for the current node number.  ROK comes with a NODE1.DAT.  When
   you hit either "[" or "]", if that NODE*.DAT doesn't exist then it
   will be created.  This is sort of hard to explain, so I'll give an
   example:

   NODE1.DAT, NODE2.DAT, and NODE3.DAT exists. You are currently
   editting NODE3.DAT.  If you hit "[", it will save the changes
   you've made to NODE3.DAT, and call up NODE2.DAT, since you've
   moved back a node.   If you hit "]", it will save the changes
   you've made to NODE2.DAT, and call up NODE3.DAT, since you've
   moved forward a node.   If you hit "]" again, since NODE4.DAT
   does not exist it will be created with the variables with the
   that was in NODE3.DAT.

   I hope that example explains how it works.  You can create up to 999
   Nodes. That's right a BBS with 999 nodes can run ROK! (In theory :-)

   When executing ROK, you run it with the command line "ROK.EXE *",
   where * is the node number. The * is the number used in NODE*.DAT,
   which is explained above.   If NODE*.DAT does not exist, ROK will
   give an error, and exit the program.

   (Q)uit to Menu.

   This will save any changes you've made to the NODE*.DAT that you are
   currently editting and return you to the Main ROK Configuration Menu.

   (Q)uit To Main ROK Configuration Menu

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (D)ivorce *ALL* Married Players In The Realm.

   One of the best options in the Realm of Kisom is that opposite sexed
   players (Male/Female) can interact with each other in adult methods.

   When writing mail, if a player has enough Charisma Points, then he/she
   will be able to propose to another player of the opposite sex.  Should
   that other player accept the proposal, then those two players will now
   be considered as a Married Couple: Husband and Wife, just like in real
   life!   However, though extensive testing has been done to ensure that
   no problems should come about when this option is utilized by players,
   the chance of errors happening is great.    This is where this feature
   comes in handy. If the marriages are not working correctly, simply use
   this option, and it will divorce EVERY player in the Realm, instantly!

   Another one of the many things ROK offers to make the SysOp's life easier.

   (T)urn "On Now" Statistic OFF For *ALL* Players.

   The "OnNow" flag is used for the Multi-Node Capability side of ROK.
   With this flag, when players are online - this lets ROK know that a
   Multi-Node Online Battle is about to take place.

   If something should happen to ROK while a player is in the game, like
   an abnormal exit, for example, and for some strange reason, the OnNow
   flag is NOT reset so the player is no longer online then ROK will not
   know if that player is online or not.   Thus, if another player comes
   in, and sees this player online, and challenges him/her the game will
   then "lock" up - since ROK tries to activate an Online Battle between
   the two players when one of them really isn't there at all.

   I hope the above example helps explain this. Extensive testing has been
   done to ensure that under almost any circumstances, the OnNow flag will
   be reset to show that the player is no longer in the game.  However, if
   the flag is not reset, then use this option. It will reset all player's
   OnNow Flag to zero, meaning that no one is in the game at that time.

   Another one of the many things ROK offers to make the SysOp's life easier.

   (O)pening ANSI/RIP Screens Are (ENABLED/DISABLED).

   This has to be one of the best Toggles installed in ROK.  If you are
   running your BBS on a slower modem (anything less than 9600 Baud) or
   you have callers who are running at 2400 Baud - then disabling these
   Introduction screens is a must, since most of them are quite long, &
   intricate.  They are of professional quality.  It will take up quite
   a bit of the users time for the entire screen to scroll down at 2400
   Baud, so this Toggle is here for you if you wish to disable them.

   This will write the Global Variable File (ROK.DAT) with the any

   Your wish, Mortal? :

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (1) Player's Real Name.

   This is the Player's REAL Name, as defined from your BBS Software's
   Drop File. It can be an actual name like Devon Brooks, or an alias,
   like Kasumi. This option should almost never be changed, unless you
   are porting your BBS's user database from Real Names to Aliases, or
   vice versa.

   (2) Gold On Hand.

   This is how much gold this player currently has on hand.  When changing
   this value, do NOT include Comma's (,).    Simply enter the value, like
   100000 (for $100,000), for example, and it will work fine.  If a "$" or
   ",", or any other non-digit value is entered anywhere in the new value,
   the value will not be changed, and will remain the same as before.

   (3) Player's Game Alias.

   This is the Player's ROK Game Alias.  This will not have any impact
   on the Player's REAL Name from the BBS.    This is simply the Alias
   that the player uses in ROK.

   Unless a user mispelt his/her name in the game, this option should
   almost never be changed.   The reason?  Simple.  Mail routines use
   the player's ALIAS as the Messenger, NOT the Record Number.   This
   is the same for Gangs.   It uses the Alias of the player - not the
   Record Number. This means that if a this player wrote a message to
   someone, then changed his/her name, when the recipient of that msg
   receives it, it will create a dummy record for the previous names'
   account -- because THAT Alias doesn't exist anymore.

   I hope that explains the dangers involved in alias changing.

   (4) Gold In Bank.

   This is how much gold this player currently has in the Bank of Kisom.
   When changing this value, do NOT include Comma's (,).    Simply enter
   the value, like 100000 (for $100,000), for example - and it will work
   fine.   If a "$", or ",", or any othner non-digit value is entered in
   the new value, the value will not be changed and will remain the same
   as before.

   (5) Current Hit Points.

   This is how many Hit Points this player currently has.  For example,
   a level one player starts out with (20 of 20) Hit Points.  If he/she
   challenged another player, and won, but lost 7 Hit Points during the
   battle, then he/she would now have (13 of 20) Hit Points.

   (6) Field Fights.

   This is how many Field Fights this player has remaining for today to
   use.    If it is an unregistered copy of Realm of Kisom, each player
   will receive 15 Fights/day.   When registered, the SysOp can set the
   amount of Fights he/she desires for the players to receive.

   (7) Maximum Hit Points.

   This is how much Maximum Hit Points this player currently has.  This
   is used in conjunction with Current Hit Points, in the form of (x of
   y), where x is Current HP, and y is Max HP.  For example: (10 of 20)
   means that this player has 10 Current HP, out of a maximum of 20 HP.

   The only time that Maximum HP is changed in the game is when a player
   advances a level in the Training Center of Level Advancement, or in a
   random event somewhere through the Realm of Kisom.

   The Maximum Hit Points variable is used when a player enters the
   Health Revival Hut to check how much Hit Points are needed to be
   healed for the player.

   (8) Player Fights.

   This is how many Player Fights this player has remaining for today to
   use. If it is an unregistered copy of Realm of Kisom each player will
   receive 3 Player Fights/day.   When registered, the SysOp can set the
   amount of Player Fights he/she desires for the players to receive.

   (9) Strength Points.

   This value is used to measure the bodily strength on this player.  It
   is used to determine the damage that this player will do to a monster
   or another player.  There are also other factors when determining the
   damage, but this is the main one. Basically, the higher the strength,
   the greater the damage done.

   Both Strength AND Defense play a VITAL role in the battles throughout ROK.

   (0) Defense Points.

   This value is used to measure the amount of wounds that a player can
   receive compared to the damage that they do. It is used to determine
   the damage they receive when attacked by another player / monster in
   the game.   Basically, the higher the defense, the less damage taken
   when attacked.

   Both Strength AND Defense play a VITAL role in the battles throughout ROK.

   (A) Charisma Points.

   Charisma is the general appearance of one's character, their voice,
   their body, their hair, basically their overall good-looking-meter.

   In ROK, Charisma is used throughout the Realm.   When players flirt
   with each other, it is used as a "measure" of how other players can
   determine if they accept their flirtatious method of communication.

   It is also used when flirting with NPC's in the game, like Logan or
   Hope.   If you have enough Charisma, eventually you will be able to
   propose marriage - to another player in the game, or to an NPC.  It
   is an option which really doesn't affect the game - but fun for the
   players nonetheless.

   (B) Current Level.

   This is the current Level of Experience that this player is at.

   I strongly recommend NOT to change this value unless you know what
   each level's advancements rewards are (player gains 10 strength at
   level 2, 30 strength at level 3, etc). Changing this value without
   knowing how to increase the other statistics will most likely kill
   this player daily - simply because he/she cannot survive against a
   monster in the Fields.

   (C) Player's Experience.

   This is the amount of Experience (XP) that this player has gained
   while playing ROK.  Each player starts out with 0 experience, and
   works their way up.  Once they've reached a certain amount of XP,
   they can challenge their level master. Should they win, they will
   then advance one level until they've reached their ultimate goal,
   Level 20. XP is gained all over ROK, but mainly in the Fields and
   during Player Battles. The higher the Experience, the more levels
   this player can advance.

   Maximum Experience a player can have is 999,999,999 (in theory only).

   (D) Player's Gender.

   When selecting this option, you are not prompted for an input. Rather,
   this is a Toggle, meaning that it cycles between two possilbe answers,
   since the two acceptable Sexes are MALE or FEMALE. An example, if this
   player is MALE, when this option is selected this player will now be a
   FEMALE, and vice versa if the player was a FEMALE at the time.

   (E) Social Ranking.

   The King in Realm of Kisom has the ability to promote mere commoners
   to a "Social Ranking", or a place in the King's Court.   These three
   rankings are: Squire (low), Duke (middle), Prince (high). This means
   that each of these three positions can be held by ONE player, & only
   only player.  For example:

                   Position "Prince" : Positiion Available
                   Position "Duke"   : Sir Valiantis Banic
                   Position "Squire" : Edgar The Great

   From the above example, you can see that both the Duke and the Squire
   positions are currently occupied by two different players. The Prince
   position is currently unoccupied meaning that it can be filled by any
   player in the Realm - except for "Sir Valiantis Banic" and "Edgar The
   Great", because they already have a Ranking.

   I hope that example explains how the Social Ranking variable works.

   Just what does these rankings give players? Basically, the only thing
   it lets these players do is sleep in the Palace of Kisom - instead of
   the Inn of Casimonda or the Fields.   Should other players still wish
   to kill these players sleeping in the Palace, it will cost dearly.

                   Position "King"   : $1,000,000 to Bribe Guards
                   Position "Prince" : $500,000   to Bribe Gaurds
                   Position "Duke"   : $250,000   to Bribe Gaurds
                   Position "Squire" : $100,000   to Bribe Gaurds

   As you can see, it will cost a player quite a bit of Gold to Bribe the
   Palace Guard to let them in and attack a player sleeping in the Palace
   of Kisom. Since each of the three Social Ranking Positions can be held
   by three different players, and the King is another player the maximum
   possible number of players sleeping in the Palace is four.

   {*} NOTE - Please make sure that when you change this Ranking to a
              Prince, Duke, or Squire - that NO other player has this
              ranking also, as it will cause MANY problems in ROK!

   (F) Where Sleeping.

   When a player is quitting the game, he/she could have three possible
   choices of where to spend the night, depending on whether or not he/
   she has a Social Ranking given from the King.  These places are:

   The Fields: It will cost you nothing to stay here. When quitting the
               game, if you exit normally from Main Street, you will be
               put in the Fields automatically. Players most often will
               attack other players who're staying in the Fields before
               shelling out Gold to bribe their way past the Bartendar,
               or the Palace Guards to attack a sleeping player.
   The Inn   : Depending on your Level of Experience, it will cost you
               anywhere from $200 to $25,000 to spend the night in the
               Inn of Casimonda. Here, you can safely sleep, unless of
               course, another player bribes the Bartendar so that he/
               she can attack you. This is often enough deterrent that
               players will leave a sleeping player alone, though.
   The Palace: If a player is the King of Kisom - or a player has a Social
               Ranking given from the King (see the above option) then he/
               she can spend the night in the Palace of Kisom.    A player
               whos sleeping here is basically ensured that they will have
               a good night's sleep without being attacked. Another player
               can - however, bribe the Palace Guards into letting them in
               the Palace and attack a sleeping player.  The costs are:

                   Position "King"   : $1,000,000 to Bribe Guards
                   Position "Prince" : $500,000   to Bribe Gaurds
                   Position "Duke"   : $250,000   to Bribe Gaurds
                   Position "Squire" : $100,000   to Bribe Gaurds

   As you can see, it will cost a player quite a bit of Gold to Bribe the
   Palace Guard to let them in and attack a player sleeping in the Palace
   of Kisom. Since each of the three Social Ranking Positions can be held
   by three different players, and the King is another player the maximum
   possible number of players sleeping in the Palace is four.

   (G) Player's Status.

   During the course of the game, each player can have two different status
   definitions - Alive, or Dead.   There is also one other, OnNow, which is
   used in Multi-Node Online Battles in the game, but the only two that you
   have to worry about is Alive or Dead.  Alive, meaning that the player is
   sleeping somewhere in the Realm (in the Inn, Fields, or the Palace), and
   can be attacked by another player at any time. Dead, well, this is self-
   explanatory. It means that this character has died for today, and cannot
   play again until maintenance is run when the first player enters ROK the
   next day.  Maintenance is where all players get ressurected by "The Gods
   of War."  (I just LOVE Greek Mythology...)

   (H) Flirted In Inn.

   This variable can be a bit tricky to understand if you're relating it to
   other Flirting variable (Flirted With Player, see below).  This variable
   is very simple to explain. Has this player flirted with Hope or Logan in
   in the Inn of Casimonda today? In ROK, if CleanMode is OFF, then players
   are eligible to "flirt" with NPC's (Non-Playing-Characters) in the game.
   Two of these NPC's are Hope (Males flirt with her), & Logan (females can
   flirt with him). This can either be TRUE, meaning that they have flirted
   in the Inn today or FALSE meaning they have not flirted in the Inn. This
   variable is always set to FALSE when Maintenance is run.

   (I) Weapon Number.

   In the Realm of Kisom, it is vital for players to attain superb weaponry
   if they wish to eventually challenge and defeat Sakar Kane, or, for that
   matter, survive in the Fields or against other players.   Thus, a Weapon
   Shop exists. Here, you can choose between 20 available weapons.  This is
   where the Weapon Number comes in.   This number equals the number of the
   weapon that this player is currently using.

   (J) Armour Number.

   Like Weapon Number, this is a vital area for players to utiltize to their
   advantage.   There is 20 Armour Types available in the Armour Shop.  This
   number equals the number of the armour that this player is using.

   (K) Current Weapon Name.

   This variable has no affect whatsoever on the Weapon Number variable.
   Rather, this is simply the name of the weapon.   The game does indeed
   give distinct names to each of it's 20 weapons - but if you wish, you
   may change it to whatever you like by using this option.

   (L) Armour Name.

   This variable has no affect whatsoever on the Armour Number variable.
   Rather, this is simply the name of the Armour.   The game does indeed
   give distinct names to each of it's 20 armours - but if you wish, you
   may change it to whatever you like by using this option.

   (M) Flirted With Player.

   This is the other half of the Flirting variable in ROK.  Writing mail
   to other players is one of the funnest things ever to do in doorgames
   today.   Thus, this is also in ROK.   Here, you can also "flirt" with
   members of the opposite sex. If CleanMode is ON then the more "adult"
   flirting options are disabled.   When writing flirtatious mail - this
   variable is turned to TRUE.  This is set to FALSE upon Maintance run.

   (N) Current Guild.

   In the Realm of Kisom - there are five different Character Classes for
   players to choose from. They are: Paladin, Cleric, Sorcerer, Assassin,
   and Warrior.   Each of these classes also has a Guild to go with them,
   complete with a GuildMaster (a human player from the Realm) & distinct
   characteristics in each of these Guilds.   A brief run down of each of
   these Guilds (they are fully explained in Page 7 - ROK Info & Notes) :

   Paladin's Guild  : Paladin's are holy knights. Holy, meaning that they
                      worship God, and follow the Church.   They can only
                      do good deeds - any evil act cannot be committed at
                      all. They also have some Clerical Spells, including
                      the all-important Heal Wounds spell. There are five
                      Spells available to Paladin's.   Players can have 3
                      of these at any given time in the game. These three
                      spells chosen by the GuildMaster.
   Cleric's Guild   : Cleric's, like Paladin's, are Holy - meaning that they
                      follow the Church, and worship God.  They too can only
                      do good deads, any evil act cannot be committed at all.
                      They have a broader range of Clerical Spells. In total,
                      there are 10 to choose from. Players can have 5 spells
                      at any given time in the game.   These five spells are
                      chosen by the GuildMaster.
   Sorcerer's Guild : Sorcerer's are Mages of the Medieval Times.  They dwell
                      in the Mystical Arts possessing the most powerful magic
                      in all of the Realm of Kisom.  If they can survive with
                      this ability - the Sorcerer can easily be the strongest
                      character in the game. In total 10 Spells are available
                      for Sorcerer's to choose from. Of these 10, players can
                      have 5 of them at any given time in the game. These ten
                      Spells are chosen by the GuildMaster.
   Assassin's Guild : An Assassin has to be the funnest character class to
                      play in ROK.   They do not have spells - nor a great
                      amount of strength.  However, they do possess one of
                      the most unique options in ROK - "Techniques".  This
                      is the coolest way to get back at another player, in
                      odd, and strange methods.   There are five different
                      Techniques available to choose from.  Of these five,
                      players can have 3 of them at any given time.  These
                      three are chosen by the GuildMaster.
   Warrior's Guild  : The Warrior is the class to choose if you're unsure
                      what class to pick.   It is basically the "default"
                      class.  Basically, the Warrior can train his or her
                      skills - and receive a random bonus on one of their
                      attributes (stats).  Also, the Warrior can exchange
                      points between two or more different stats. Meaning
                      for example, they could take Ten Hit Points and add
                      it to their Strength Total.    That would mean they
                      now have 10 extra Strength - and 10 less Hit Points
                      than they used to.   There are five different stats
                      that a Warrior can take/give points to. Hit Points,
                      Defense, Strength, Charisma, and Field Fights.   Of
                      these five, players can trade between three of them
                      at any given time.  These three are selected by the
                      GuildMaster.

   The above was a brief explanation of each of the five different Guilds in
   Realm of Kisom.   As you can see, each of them has a GuildMaster (a human
   player from the game), and each has distinct characteristics.  These make
   ROK generally more enjoyable.  There's also a neat little storyline to go
   along with how these Guild's (named the Guilds of Astradam) were created.

   When changing the Guilds variable, *PLEASE* make sure that this player is
   NOT the GuildMaster, as it will surely mess up your game quickly.  What I
   mean by this is that if you are editting a player who is currently in the
   Paladin's Guild and wish to change him to the Sorcerer's Guild, then make
   sure that he/she is NOT the GuildMaster of the Paladin's Guild as it will
   definitely screw up your game.

   (!) Find User Name.

   This option lets the person running ROKCFG.EXE to search the entire data
   file (PLAYER.DAT) for a specific BBS User Name (not the ROK Game alias).
   If no alias is found, it will tell you this, and return back to the same
   account record.   When it has found a name, it will prompt you to see if
   the full name is correct, in a Yes/No answer format.  If you answer Yes,
   then it will load that account. You can use a FULL or PARTIAL name here.

   (@) Edit Guild Skills.

   The following screen will appear upon entering this option:

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   ** Realm of Kisom Version 1.00  Player Editor - ROK Player Account #(x) **

   (1) Prayed to the Gods today?    :        (2) Spells Chosen    :
   (3) Unused Warrior Skill's Left  :        (4) Spells Remaining :

   (R)eturn to Main Player Editor Menu

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (1) Prayed to the Gods today?

   If a player is in the Paladin's, Cleric's, or Sorcerer's Guild, there is
   an option to pray to their Diety (demi-God). In reward for praying, they
   receive a random bonus on one of their statistics attributes.    Setting
   this to FALSE will let the player pray today.   Likewise, a TRUE setting
   will not let the player pray again until maintenance is ran the next day.

   (2) Spells Chosen.

   This is how many spells this player has already chosen.  It is not
   recommended to change this value, as it could unbalance the game very
   quickly.

   (3) Unused Warrior Skills Left.

   This stat, obviously, is for Warrior's only.  Warrior's special ability
   is that they can take points away from a stat and add it to another one.
   This is explained above in the Current Guild Option in the Player Editor.
   Thus, this is how many unused points this player has remaining available
   to distribute.

   (4) Spells Remaining.

   The GuildMaster of each Guild selects "Spells".  Paladin's, Cleric's, and
   Sorcerer's have spells they can learn, while Assassin's have "Techniques",
   and Warriors have tradeable attributes.    Increasing this value will let
   this player have more spells available to learn.    It is not recommended
   that you change this value, as it could unbalance the game quite quickly.

   (R)eturn to Main Player Editor Menu.

   This option will simply return to to the Player Editor Menu.

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   (#) Delete Player.

   This option will delete the current player record completely.  Right now,
   it will simply change all of the information to blank - Real Name, Alias,
   Weapon/Armour, etc, but a blank account will still exist in this spot. If
   need be, I will include an option to totally erase blank records from the
   PLAYER.DAT, but at this point in time there really is no need for such an
   option.

   {*} NOTE - Do not worry if you accidentally press the "#" key.  It will
   prompt you for a Y/N answer to check if you are sure you wish to delete
   this player.

   ([) Back Up One Account.

   If you are running an registered copy, it will save changes to the current
   user record, and back up one account record.   The same goes for an unreg-
   istered copy, except it won't save the changes you may have made.   What I
   mean by "backing up one account" is this - An example:

   You are currently editting User Account #8 - John Doe's Account.  Pressing
   the "[" key will load account #7, whoever's account that may be. Again, if
   it's a registered copy, it will save changes, but if it is an unregistered
   copy, it won't.

   (]) Advance One Account.

   If you are running an registered copy, it will save changes to the current
   user record, and advance one account record.   The same goes for an unreg-
   istered copy, except it won't save the changes you may have made.   What I
   mean by "advancing one account" is this - An example:

   You are currently editting User Account #8 - John Doe's Account.  Pressing
   the "]" key will load account #9, whoever's account that may be. Again, if
   it's a registered copy, it will save changes, but if it is an unregistered
   copy, it won't.

   (R) Return To Menu.

   If you are running a registered copy of ROK it will save any changes you
   may have made to the current player record, and return to to the Editors
   Menu. If you are running an unregistered copy of Realm of Kisom, it will
   not save any changes you have made.

   (2) Monster Editor explained:

   {*} NOTE - If you are running an Unregistered Copy of Realm of Kisom
              any changes you make while in the Mon. Editor will not be
              saved. You can view what the editor is like to give you a
              feel of what the editor can do upon registering the game.

   The following screen will appear upon entering this option:

   ** ROK V1.00  Monster Editor - Account #(x) **

   (2) Hand Gold    :
   (3) Weapon Name  :
   (4) Strength     :
   (5) Experience   :
   (6) Hit Points   :

   ([) Back One (]) Ahead One (R) Return To Menu

   Your wish, Mortal? :

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (1) Monster Name.

   This is simply the name of the current monster.  It can be anything
   from a simple ameoba, to something like the Grim Reaper.

   (2) Hand Gold.

   This is how much Gold the player receives when s/he kills this monster.
   For example, if this monster had $500 Gold, the player would receive
   $500 should s/he win when fighting this monster.

   (3) Weapon Name.

   Like Monster Name, this is simply the weapon that this monster uses
   to attack enemies.   It can be anything at all.  It is displayed to
   the character upon first screen when they battle.

   (4) Strength.

   This is the range of attack that this monster does.  ROK calculates
   each monsters strength randomly.  Thus, there is a wide range of attack
   damage values that can be given.  In short, the higher this number is,
   the greater the damage done.

   (5) Experience.

   Like Hand Gold, this is how much experience a character gets as a
   reward when this monster is defeated.  For example, if this value
   was 100, when a character kills this monster, s/he would then get
   100 Experience.

   (6) Hit Points.

   This is simply how many Hit Points (HP) this monster has.  The higher
   the value will usually mean the harder to defeat.  When a player attacks
   a monster, the damage inflicted from these attacks is subtracted from
   this HP value.  When this HP value reaches 0 or below, then the monster
   is killed.  Pretty simple.

   ([) Back One.

   If you are running an registered copy, it will save changes to the current
   mon. record, and back up one account record.   The same goes for an unreg-
   istered copy, except it won't save the changes you may have made.   What I
   mean by "backing up one account" is this - An example:

   You are currently editting Mon. Account #8 - John Doe's Account.  Pressing
   the "[" key will load account #7, whoever's account that may be. Again, if
   it's a registered copy, it will save changes, but if it is an unregistered
   copy, it won't.

   (]) Ahead One.

   If you are running an registered copy, it will save changes to the current
   mon. record, and advance one account record.   The same goes for an unreg-
   istered copy, except it won't save the changes you may have made.   What I
   mean by "advancing one account" is this - An example:

   You are currently editting Mon. Account #8 - John Doe's Account.  Pressing
   the "]" key will load account #9, whoever's account that may be. Again, if
   it's a registered copy, it will save changes, but if it is an unregistered
   copy, it won't.

   (R) Return to Menu

   If you are running a registered copy of ROK it will save any changes you
   may have made to the current monster record and return to to the Editors
   Menu. If you are running an unregistered copy of Realm of Kisom, it will
   not save any changes you have made.

   (3) Level Editor explained:

   {*} NOTE - If you are running an Unregistered Copy of Realm of Kisom
              any changes you make while in the Lev. Editor will not be
              saved. You can view what the editor is like to give you a
              feel of what the editor can do upon registering the game.

   The following screen will appear upon entering this option:

   ** ROK V1.00  Level Editor - Level #(x) **

   (1) Master's Name  :
   (2) Experience Req :
   (3) Weapon Name    :
   (4) Strength Pts.  :
   (5) Health Points  :
   (6) Defense Points :

   ([) Back One (]) Ahead One (R) Return To Menu

   Your wish, Mortal? :

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (1) Master's Name.

   This is simply the name of the Level Master.  Nothing more, nothing less.

   (2) Experience Req.

   This is the Experience required before a player can challenge this master
   and advance a level.  For example, if this value was 1,000, then a player
   would need at least 1,000 before s/he can challenge this master & advance
   a level.

   (3) Weapon Name.

   This is simply the name of the Weapon that the Level Master uses in
   battles.  This has no effect on the strength meter, though.

   (4) Strength Pts.

   This is the range of attack that this master does.  ROK calculates
   each masters strength randomly.  Thus, there is a wide range of attack
   damage values that can be given.  In short, the higher this number is,
   the greater the damage done.

   (5) Health Points.

   This is simply how many Hit Points (HP) this master has.  The higher
   the value will usually mean the harder to defeat.  When a player attacks
   a monster, the damage inflicted from these attacks is subtracted from
   this HP value.  When this HP value reaches 0 or below, then the master
   is defeated, and the player advances one level.

   (6) Defense Points.

   This value is subtracted from the damage inflicted from a player's
   attack.  For example, if the damage inflicted was 500, and this master's
   defense was 250, then the damage would now be 250.

   ([) Back One.

   If you are running an registered copy, it will save changes to the current
   mas. record, and back up one account record.   The same goes for an unreg-
   istered copy, except it won't save the changes you may have made.   What I
   mean by "backing up one account" is this - An example:

   You are currently editting Mas. Account #8 - John Doe's Account.  Pressing
   the "[" key will load account #7, whoever's account that may be. Again, if
   it's a registered copy, it will save changes, but if it is an unregistered
   copy, it won't.

   (]) Ahead One.

   If you are running an registered copy, it will save changes to the current
   mas. record, and advance one account record.   The same goes for an unreg-
   istered copy, except it won't save the changes you may have made.   What I
   mean by "advancing one account" is this - An example:

   You are currently editting Mas. Account #8 - John Doe's Account.  Pressing
   the "]" key will load account #9, whoever's account that may be. Again, if
   it's a registered copy, it will save changes, but if it is an unregistered
   copy, it won't.

   (R) Return To Menu.

   If you are running a registered copy of ROK it will save any changes you
   may have made to the current master record, and return to to the Editors
   Menu. If you are running an unregistered copy of Realm of Kisom, it will
   not save any changes you have made.

   (4) Conversation Editor explained:

   {*} NOTE - If you are running an Unregistered Copy of Realm of Kisom
              this editor will simply display the Chat File then return
              to the Editors Menu.

   The following line will appear upon entering this option:

   Edit which Conversation File? <I>nn/<R>ebel Corner/<P>alace :

   <I>nn will display "ROKINN.TXT", <R>ebel Corner will display "REBEL.TXT",
   and <P>alace will display "PALACE.TXT".  For all files, this is the screen
   that appears:

   ** ROK v1.00 - Editting Conversation File - (filename) **

   Edit which Line (1..6), or <Q>uit back to the Editors Menu :

   Pressing <Q> will return you to the Editors Menu.

   Choosing 1..6 will bring this up:

   Old Line: "<old line text>                                              "

   After you press ENTER, it will replace the line in the file with the
   new line you just entered.  That's basically it, in a nut shell. :-)

   (5) "Atma" Editor explained:

   {*} NOTE - If you are running an Unregistered Copy of Realm of Kisom
              any changes you make while in the Atma Editor will not be
              saved. You can view what the editor is like to give you a
              feel of what the editor can do upon registering the game.

   {*} NOTE - "Atma" is explained on Page 7 (ROK Info & Notes).

   The following screen will appear upon entering this option:

   ** ROK v1.00 - Atma Editor **

 û (1) Allow Players to Fight Atma?  :
   (2) Experience Reward When Killed :
   (3) Atma's Legendary Weapon Name  :
   (4) Atma's Strength Points Rating :
   (5) Atma's Defensive Pts. Rating  :
   (6) Atma's Maximum Health Points  :

   (R) Return to the Editors Menu

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (1) Allow Players to Fight Atma?

   This is whether or not you want to let your players fight Atma.

   (2) Experience Reward When Killed.

   If Atma is defeated, this value is given to the player as an Experience
   Reward.   Since Atma is supposedly a supreme enemy, this value is quite
   high.  However, change as you so desire.

   (3) Atma's Legendary Weapon Name.

   This is the Weapon that the player receives for a day if s/he defeats
   Atma.  Basically, it's supposedly a Legendary Weapon, like "Excalibur",
   King Arthur's ultimate weapon.  This weapon is three times as strong as
   the highest possible weapon sold in the Weapon Shop.  However, a player
   who receives this weapon is only allowed to use it for one day, to make
   it fair to other players.

   (4) Atma's Strength Points Rating.

   ROK calculates Atma's attack damage using this value.  Basically, the
   higher the value, the more damage Atma will do to a player.  Since Atma
   is a supreme enemy, this value is higher than normal.

   (5) Atma's Defensive Pts. Rating.

   ROK subtracts the player's damage by this value - Atma's defense.  In
   short, the higher the value, the less damage a player will inflict on
   Atma.  Since Atma is a supreme enemy, this value is quite high.

   (6) Atma's Maximum Health Points.

   This is simply how many HP Atma has.  The damage inflicted from a player
   is subtracted from this value.  When this value is less than or equal to
   0, Atma is defeated.  Since Atma is a supreme enemy, this value is quite
   high.  Basically, the higher the HP, the harder it is to kill Atma.

   (R) Return to the Editors Menu.

   If you are running a registered copy of ROK it will save any changes you
   may have made to the Atma record, and return you to the Editors Menu. If
   If you are running an unregistered copy of ROK it won't save any changes
   you've made.

   (6) Inn Editor explained:

   {*} NOTE - If you are running an Unregistered Copy of Realm of Kisom
              any changes you make while in the Inn Editor will not be
              saved. You can view what the editor is like to give you a
              feel of what the editor can do upon registering the game.

   {*} NOTE - The Inn Ownership (Buying/Selling) is explained on Page 7
              (ROK Info & Notes).

   The following screen will appear upon entering this option:

   ** ROK v1.00 - Inn Editor **

   (1) Allow Inn For Sale? :
   (2) Current Owner Name  :
   (3) Price To Get A Room :

   (R) Return to the Editors Menu

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (1) Allow Inn For Sale?

   This is a toggle for the SysOp to enable/disable the buying and selling
   of the Inn of Casimonda between players.  Enabling this will let players
   own the Inn, set the prices of sleeping, and receive the subsequent Gold
   they get from being owner.

   (2) Current Owner Name.

   This is simply the owner of the Inn at the current time.  If no one owns
   the Inn, then "Logan" (an NPC) owns it.  Players must first purchase the
   Inn from him, then that player owns it.

   (3) Price To Get A Room.

   This value is multiplied by the player's level.  The result is the cost
   they must pay to the Owner if they wish to spend the night in the Inn.

   For example, if this value was $500, then a level one would pay $500 to
   spend the night, a level two would pay $1000, 3 would pay $1500, etc...

   This is also the value that is used when other players wish to attack a
   sleeping guest by bribing Logan, the Bartender. The same calculation is
   used as explaned above.

   (R) Return to the Editors Menu.

   If you are running a registered copy of ROK it will save any changes you
   may have made to the Inn Record - and return you to the Editors Menu. If
   If you are running an unregistered copy of ROK it won't save any changes
   you've made.

   (7) Kingdom Editor explained:

   {*} NOTE - If you are running an Unregistered Copy of Realm of Kisom

   (2) Kingdom Soldiers :
   (3) Rebel's Gold     :
   (4) Rebel's Soldiers :

   (R) Return to the Editors Menu

   An explanation of each option in this menu:

   (1) Kingdom Gold.

   This is the amount of Gold that the Kingdom has saved up.  The King/Queen
   uses this to hire new Soldiers, or just to use it for their own purposes.

   (2) Kingdom Soldiers.

   This is the amount of Soldiers the Kingdom has in their Army. This is used
   when/if the Kingdom is invaded from another Realm such as Aphrenam/Ishkan,
   or when someone instigates a Rebellion in the Realm.

   (3) Rebel's Gold.

   Like Kingdom Gold, this is the total amount of Gold that the Rebel's have
   saved up.  It's used to hire Soldiers into the Rebel's Army.

   (4) Rebel's Soldiers.

   Again, like Kingdom Soldiers, this is the amount of Soldiers in the Rebel's

   Realm of Kisom is distributed in a "ShareWare" format.  What does ShareWare
   mean?  Basically, it means that you, as a Consumer, are allowed to test ROK
   for as long as you wish.    An unregistered copy of ROK is fully functional
   to an extent - half the game. Once players reach Level 10, they will not be
   allowed to continue until it is registered. That is the only restriction in
   ROK, though, except for the Editors.

   Just what does someone get when they register?  This:

   * You will receive a Registration Code for YOUR SysOp Name or Alias, and
     YOUR BBS Name -- Easily entered in the (E)nter Registration Codes option
     in ROKCFG.EXE.
   * Twice as many Levels, Level Masters, and Enemies!
   * Players can advance past Level 10 and finish the game.
   * Players can access the "secret" ending within the game.
   * You can customize how many Field Fights and Player Fights your users
     are allowed to have per day.
   * Supporting *quality* ShareWare, such as this, helps create a better
     ShareWare market for *ALL* ShareWare authors and their products.
   * Player Editor in ROKCFG.EXE is fully functional.  Edit almost EVERY
     aspect of each player record in your ROK Game!
   * Monster Editor in ROKCFG.EXE is fully functional.  Customize the ROK
     enemies to suit your desires!   Every variable in the Monster Record
     is configurable when registered!
   * Level Editor in ROKCFG.EXE is fully functional.  Edit the amount of
     Experience that is needed for a player to advance to a certain level.
     Customize your game so that it will take players quite a bit of time,
     or no time at all to advance levels!  Every variable in the Level Master's
     record is fully configurable when registered!
   * Conversation Editor in ROKCFG.EXE is fully functional.  Edit lines of
     text in the Inn or Rebel's Corner conversation.  View what your players
     are saying, monitor swear words, change as you wish - all in just a few
     key presses when you register your copy of Realm of Kisom!
   * "Atma" Editor in ROKCFG.EXE is fully functional.  Customize Atma from a
     strong Warrior to an even stronger Warrior, or even a weaker Warrior!
     Rename Atma's Legendary Weapon to suit what you wish!  Atma's entire
     variable record is fully configurable when registered!
   * Inn Editor in ROKCFG.EXE is fully functional.  Set the prices for players
     to sleep in the Inn, or the bribing prices for players to pay to Logan to
     attack a sleeping guest!  Toggle the Inn buying/selling ON/OFF, set the
     current selling price, and set the Current Owner's Name!  The entire Inn
     variable record is fully configurable when registered!
   * Possibly best of all - Free Updates!  Registering ROK is a one-time
     thing.  Pay the $20.00 once, and that's it!  Your registered for life.
     All future versions of ROK will work with your registration codes.
   * You are entitled to a higher level of assistance should anything go
     wrong while you run ROK.  I fully support my product to unregistered
     SysOp's, but if I know that you've registered, chances are I'll be a
     little more eager to serve and help you out, if I can.  Don't get me
     wrong, I'm eager to help unregistered SysOp's as well. :)

   The great thing about ShareWare is that you know what you are going to be
   receiving if you register your copy of Realm of Kisom.  If you dislike an
   option/feature in ROK, or you've found a bug, do not send money expecting
   that the registration code will make it work better. Registering ROK will
   only allow players to play the other half of the game - it doesn't unlock
   any "Registered-Only" features within the game.

   Even if you're NOT a SysOp, you can still register Realm of Kisom for the
   same price.  It doesn't matter to me at all.   If you want ROK registered
   to a name without a BBS Name, specify that when you fill out REGISTER.DOC
   and I will be more than happy to do that for you!

   {*} NOTE - If you do not have a printer on your computer, simply
   take a piece of paper, and write down the following information:

   SysOp Name         :                     Your Address   :
   BBS Name           :                     State/Province :
   Voice Phone Number :                     Postal Code    :
   BBS Phone Number   :                     Suggestion(s)  :

   You CAN do it this way if you wish, but I would prefer a typed
   form as its much easier to read than some people's hand writing.

   The current asking price of registration is $20.00.  I accept BOTH USA
   and Canadian funds.  If you are a US citizen, you can exchange your US
   Funds into Canadian, and the cost will drop by nearly $5.00 due to the
   poor Canadian vs. American dollar rate.

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   However, I do grant a special offer to those who wish to register ROK:

   If you and a friend would like to register ROK together, then you are
   entitled to a HUGE discount!  This is how to attain this special offer:

   ** INSTEAD OF $20.00, THE COST DROPS TO $10.00!  A SAVINGS OF 50%! **

   First, each of you fill out a seperate registration form.  Include the
   information you wish, just as if you were registering normally.  Next,
   put BOTH forms in the same envelope.   Then, since you are entitled to
   receive the 50% off deal - each person place their registration amount
   in the same envelope.  That way, when I open the envelope, I know that
   you and this other person have registered together, thus entitling you
   to the 50% off deal. If both forms are not together in the same order,
   you will not receive the 50% off deal, and I will return your money to
   you at no charge to you.

   This offer works for any amounts of people.  2 People together would
   make the order in the envelope $20.00 - $10.00 each.  4 People would
   make the order in the envelope $40.00 - $10.00 each.  It works for
   all amounts of people. If 10 SysOp's wanted to register ROK together,
   together, it would be $100.00 - $10.00 each.  Great deal, hey? :-)

   I hope that explains how the deal works.  If you have any questions,
   feel free to contact me.  Contact methods are given on Page 8 (How to
   Contact Devon Brooks, The Author).  I'd me more than happy to help you
   out and answer any questions you might have!

   Since I live in Canada, mail will take a little longer to get to me if
   you are sending it from the United States.  There is a date on the Reg
   Form to tell me what the average time is for mail to get to me.   It's
   about 1 and a half weeks for mail to reach me.  So, give me some time,
   and your registration code usually be return to you within 24 hours of
   me receiving it.   Please allow 2-4 weeks for your code to be returned
   to you.  If it takes longer than this, by all means, please contact me
   and ask me what the hold up is.  For some southern states, it may take
   even longer than four weeks to return the registration code to you.

   At this time, we do not have an OnLine Registration Site set up.  However,
   one is in the works.  It should be up and running very soon, hopefully. :)

   If you wish to register ROK, fill out REGISTER.DOC, and mail it to the
   address given on Page 8 (How to Contact Devon Brooks, The Author).

   ** Please consider registering Realm of Kisom if you haven't already! **

ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
³ Realm of Kisom Version 1.00            Page 5 - Installing Realm of Kisom ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

   Installing Realm of Kisom is *very* easy.  Simply follow these steps:

   1. It is suggested to create a seperate ROK directory.
   2. Unzip the ROKV094D.ZIP file into this directory.
   3. Run ROKCFG.EXE.  Create the ROK.DAT file, if it asks you to.
   4. In ROKCFG.EXE, go into (S)etup Node(s) for BBS's.  Here, create
      as many NODE*.DAT files as you wish.  There must be one NODE*.DAT
      file for every Node you run on your BBS.  (IE, if you have 10 Nodes,
      you will need NODE1.DAT, NODE2.DAT ... all the way to NODE10.DAT)
      In this menu, it allows you to configure your BBS Drop File type,
      Com Port, and Com Routines.

      {*} NOTE - Don't worry.  You won't have to manually edit all your
                 nodes.  When you create a new node, it uses the previous
                 node's values.

   5. Setup your BBS to run ROK.  Consult your BBS Software Documentation
      for information on running doorgames, and executing batch files.

      For single-line BBS's, this is the suggested batch file setup:

      @ECHO OFF                    - Do not display what is happening
      CD\BBS\DOORS\ROK             - Change Dir to the ROK Directory
      COPY \BBS\<dropfile>         - Copy your DropFile into the ROK Dir
      NOW_OFF.EXE                  - Turn "OnNow" Flags off for all players
      ROK.EXE 1                    - Run ROK on Node #1 (for one-node BBS's)
      CD\BBS                       - Return to the BBS Directory
      EXIT                         - Exit back to the BBS

      For Multi-Node BBS's (more than one Node), this is the suggested
      batch file setup:

      @ECHO OFF                    - Do not display what is happening
      CD\BBS\DOORS\ROK             - Change Dir to the ROK Directory
      ROK.EXE * /P<pathtodropfile> - Run ROK.EXE, where "*" is the Node Number,
                                     and the /P<path> tells ROK where the Drop
                                     File is (with or without the trailing back-
                                     slash <"\">).
      CD\BBS                       - Return to the BBS Directory
      EXIT                         - Exit back to the BBS

      {*} NOTE - It is *not* necessary to copy the dropfile into the ROK
                 directory.   If do not want to copy it, then you *must*
                 use this command line to call ROK:

                 ROK.EXE * /P<pathtodropfile>

                 Where "*" is the node number (consult your BBS Software
                 Documentation for information regarding passing the node
                 number to command line).   The <pathtodropfile> does not
                 need a trailing backslash (\) at the end, but if you put
                 it there, it won't hurt either.

   That's it!  Pretty simple, hey? :-)  If you have any questions regarding
   installing Realm of Kisom, please, by all means contact me and feel free
   to ask me anything you like. Ways to contact me are given on Page 8 (How
   to contact Devon Brooks, The Author).

   I hope that fully explains how to install Realm of Kisom on your BBS!

   This section is here to answer some Frequently Asked Questions.

   Question: "When a user tries to access ROK on my BBS, it doesn't do
             anything, and simply returns them to the BBS!"

   Answer  : This is most likely caused by your ROK Batch file not executing
             ROK properly.   See the above section for information on how to
             setup your batch file.

             {*} NOTE - ROK *might* not be getting enough Memory!  Here's a
                        way to check if this is the problem: If, in the ROK
                        batch file, you have "@ECHO OFF", delete that, then
                        run ROK again. It should know show you what's going
                        on when it tries to execute ROK from your BBS.  See
                        where it executes the command line - and if it says
                        something like: "Not enough memory to run program",
                        then that's the problem!  :-)  If you are unsure of
                        just how much Memory your BBS takes up, run MEM.EXE
                        in the batch file and see.   Then, consult your BBS
                        Documentation for info on reducing memory usage. It
                        should then work for you.   ROK automatically loads
                        most of it's files into EMS, if it's available.

   Question: "ROK has the OnNow flag ON for a user who isn't even in the
             game!  Another user enters, challenges that person, and ROK
             screws up there!  Help!"

   Answer  : This error is caused by an Abnormal Exit from the game.  Either
             ROK had an error, a lock-up, power failure, etc.  This does not
             happen when a user drops carrier, though, ROK is smart that way.

             For Single-Line BBS's, the solution is *very* simple.  Run
             NOW_OFF.EXE in the batch file that runs ROK (explained above).
             This will turn the OnNow flag off for every user *before* a
             user enters the game.

             For Multi-Node BBS's, this is the fix.  You can run NOW_OFF.EXE
             if you wish.   However, a more important step is to notify your
             users that after seven seconds of no response from the other end
             of the online duel, a player can choose to leave the fight.

             What the heck am I talking about?  Here's an example to help:

             Player A has had an abnormal exit from the game.  The OnNow flag
             for this character has remained "ON".  Player B enters the game,
             sees that Player A is online, and challenges that player.  After
             seven seconds of Player A not responding in the fight - Player B
             can choose to leave it.  It's very simple!   After this Player A
             doesn't respond, Player B should know that Player A isn't really
             online.

             Hope that explains it! :-)

   Question: "Why the heck are there so many MSG*_*.DAT files?"

   Answer  : Those are Message Data Files.  They're mail waiting to be read
             by certain players.

   Question: "I cannot figure out how to pass the correct Node Number to the
             batch file ROK command line!  Help!"

   Answer  : Each BBS Software is different.  Almost all of them use a symbol
             to represent a Node Number.    You will have to consult your BBS
             Software Documentation to see how to do it.  Sorry I can't be of
             any more assistance in this area.

   Question: "ROK locks up at the Introduction ANSI/RIP Screen!"

   Answer  : Well, I don't have a clue why this should happen.  If this is a
             persistant error, there is a Toggle to disable showing it. It's
             in ROKCFG.EXE's (M)iscellaneous Maintenance Menu. Simply Toggle
             it to OFF, and you should have no more problems.

             {*} NOTE - You can experiment with the three different FOSSIL
                        Driver types (explained above), that may cause the
                        Into ANSI/RIP lockups to go away.

   Question: "A player was able to marry someone who wasn't even in the game!"

   Answer  : In ROKCFG.EXE's (M)iscellaneous Maintenance Menu, there is an
             option to Divorce *ALL* Married Players in the Realm.  If this
             error should ever happen, simply run this option, and everything
             should be fine.

   Question: "My registration code doesn't work!  Help me out, please!"

   Answer  : Extensive testing has been done to ensure that your registration
             code *should* work.  However, if it does not, DON'T PANIC! :-)

             Simply contact the me, and I'd be more than happy to help you out
             with this problem. Ways of contacting me are given on Page 8 (How
             to Contact Devon Brooks, The Author).

   Question: "I don't know how to change my US funds into Canadian Funds!"

   Answer  : Don't bother!  I accept BOTH Canadian AND US Funds in registration
             forms!

   Question: "I use DORINFO1.DEF as my dropfile.  I use it to run all my
             nodes.  ROK doesn't recognize that it's supposed to be Node #2
             with a DORINFO1.DEF file!  Help!"

   Answer  : Most BBS Softwares that support DORINFO also support DOOR.SYS.
             If your BBS Supports both of these, try changing it to DOOR.SYS.
             If not, then run ROK with this command line:

             ROK.EXE * /P<pathtodropfile>

             Where "*" is the node number, /P<pathtodropfile> tells ROK where
             to look for the DropFile.  It does not matter if this path has the
             trailing backslash ("\") or not.

             I think that should work, hopefully.

   Question: "I want to run Maintenance today - again!"

   Answer  : Simply delete TIME.DAT from your ROK Directory.  The next time
             ROK is ran, Maintenance will execute again.

   Question: "I have a bug report that isn't addressed anywhere in your ROK
             documentation!"

   Answer  : Fabulous!  Fill out BUGRPT.FRM.  Send this to me.  Ways of
             contacting me are given on Page 8 (How to Contact Devon Brooks,
             The Author).  *Please* be as clear as possible when explaining
             the report!  Also, please print, if you can, or write neatly! :)

   Question: "I'm stumped.  Nothing seems to work!"

   Answer  : Consult Page 7 (ROK Info & Notes).  There, it will give you the
             ROK Command Line Parameters.  This, hopefully, will help you out.

   I hope I have covered most of the topics here.  If your question is not
   addressed, then feel free to contact me.  Ways of contacting me are given
   on Page 8 (How to Contact Devon Brooks, The Author).

   Alternatively, you may call my BBS - The Inner City BBS, at 1-306-694-5864.
   There is an entire message base setup for ROK alone (Msg.Area #4).  This is
   the area to discuss comments/suggestions on how to improve ROK, bug reports
   and more.  Almost everything is addressed in this area.

   Hopefully, soon, there will be a ROK Echo available on Plannet Connect.
   When it is available, I will hopefully be addressing messages in there.

   The latest version of ROK can always be FREQed from 1:140/129, using
   the Magic Name of "ROK".   I run on a 33.6k Modem, so it should take
   less than 2-3 minutes for you to get the latest version!  It is also

   One of the most unique options in ROK is called EGO support.  What the
   heck is EGO support, you ask?  Well, here's an explanation:

   EGO stands for "Extra Game Option."

   The King/Queen of Kisom can construct "Buildings".  These Buildings are
   called EGO's.  These EGO's are coded into the game by Devon Brooks (The
   Author), NOT a 3rd Party Programmer. Each EGO costs a certain amount of
   Gold.    Once this requirement of Gold is met, then this EGO can now be
   accessable for all players, and a new EGO can be constructed.    As new
   ideas come up, possible future EGO's will be added by The Author.

   When the King/Queen decides which EGO to be built - one day is allocated
   for the players in the game to vote Yes/No to be in favour of or opposed
   to the building of this EGO.  If the majority of players do not want the
   EGO to be built - then they will get to decide which EGO they want to be
   built.   Basically, it's a "Senate" type of thing.   If the players vote
   against the King/Queen, then the Senate will overrule the King and build
   a new EGO, just as the players requested.

   ** Don't make the mistake, EGO's are *NOT* IGM's! **

   Rather, EGO's are options within the game.  At this point in time, I am
   not allowing 3rd Party Programmers to create EGO's for ROK.  By looking
   at other games, IGM's cause nothing but problems.   However, I'm always
   open to change, so this opinion on 3rd Party Programmers *could* change.

   Hope that explains how EGO's work!

   Another one of the many unique features of ROK is the five different
   character classes available to players.  An explanation of each class:

   Paladin  - This type of character can do only good deeds.  Since Paladin's
              are Holy Knights, they worship God.  Paladin's also can wield a
              limited amount of Clerical Spells; the first five of ten can be
              accessed by all Paladin's - three of which are available at the
              same time. These five spells are: Heal Wounds, View Other Char,
              Enchant Weapon, Enchant Armour, and Cure All Diseases. *All* of
              these spells are explained in the next class (Cleric), how they
              work, what they do, etc.

   Cleric   - Like Paladin's, this type of character can also do only good
              deeds.  Since Cleric's are Holy, they worship God.  Cleric's
              wield a wide variety of Spells - five of which are available
              at the same time.   These ten spells are - Heal Wounds, View
              Other Char, Enchant Weapon, Enchant Armour, Cure All Diseases,
              Holy Hammer, White Lore, Blindness, God's Divine, and Complete
              Healing.  Here's a complete explanation of each of these spells:

              Heal Wounds - This will Heal *half* of all the wounds that a
                            character has and let the player choose another
                            option in the battle.  For example, if a player
                            had (10 of 20) HP, casting this spell will heal
                            5 HP since that is half of what this player has
                            sustained as damage.  After this spell is cast,
                            the player will then be able to choose another
                            option in the battle.

              View Other Char - Casting this spell will enable you to view
                                another character's statistics.  This screen
                                is the same as if it a player viewing his or
                                her statistics, but it will have the desired
                                character's stats.  Usefulness?   Well, it's
                                easy to see which players have Gold on their
                                Hand, their strength, etc, before they attack
                                them.

              Enchant Weapon - Just as the spell says, casting this will give
                               a player a 10% bonus on his/her attack damage.
                               Cast this once any time in your turn, and it's
                               duration will last until you quit the game.

              Enchant Armour - Like Enchant Armour, casting this spell will
                               give a player a 10% bonus on his/her Armour.
                               This means that 10% will be subtracted from
                               the damage received from a Monster/Player.
                               Cast this once any time in your turn, and it's
                               duration will last until you quit the game.

              Cure All Dieseases - Anther one of ROK's many unique features is
                                   that players have the ability to Cure/Bless
                                   other players.  If a player is cursed, then
                                   he/she must find a cure. Casting this spell
                                   will Cure All Diseases, just as it says.

              Holy Hammer - A mythical spell known only has "Holy Hammer" was
                            thought to be a Spell wielded by the Cleric's. It
                            has the potential to do 5 times as much damage as
                            a normal attack.

              White Lore - Pure energy, White Lore is the central focus of the
                           Cleric's faith in the Good Lord. This blast has the
                           potential to do 6 times as much damage as a normal
                           attack.

              Blindness - Just as the spell name says, this flash of light can
                          effectively "blind" the opponent, thus reducing his/
                          her chance of hitting you by 50%.

              God's Divine - Calling upon forces of Divinity, God's Divine is
                             the most potent spell in the Cleric's aresenal.
                             Seemingly from God himself, this blast of energy
                             has the potential of doing 8 times as much damage
                             as a normal attack.

              Complete Healing - Just as the spell name says, casting this will
                                 heal a player of his wounds completely then
                                 let the player choose another option in the
                                 battle.  For example, if a player had (1 of
                                 100) HP, this spell would heal 99 HP, since
                                 that is the wounds sustained.    Simply the
                                 most powerful non-offensive spell available
                                 to Cleric's,

   Sorcerer - This type of character, if trained correctly, could be the most
              powerful character in the entire game, easily. Sorcerer's wield
              "Black" Magic, or magic opposed to Paladin's/Cleric's.     If a
              player is patient with this character, in time, Sorcerer's grow
              to be simply the most powerful character.    Sorcerer's wield a
              wide variety of Spells, five of which are available at the same
              time.    These ten spells are - Magic Missile, Shield, Befriend
              Enemy, Flaming Ball, Black Lore, Dispel Magic, Ice Storm, Clone
              Self, Meteor Storm, and Reincarnation.   A complete explanation
              of each of these spells:

              Magic Missile - M. Missile has the potential of doing 5 times
                              as much damage as a normal attack. Basically,
                              this spell creates a "Missile", and shoots it
                              at the desired target.

              Shield - This spell will effectively reduce the damage taken
                       from an enemy by 25%.  Meaning, that if an opponent
                       hit you for 100 Damage - this spell would reduce it
                       to 75.  Quite useful.

              Befriend Enemy - One of the best spells that Sorcerer's can
                               wield - Befriend Enemy lets you escape the
                               battle instantaneously.   Just as it says,
                               you "Befriend" your opponent, & the battle
                               does not continue. *Very* useful if you're
                               in a battle you cannot win.

              Flaming Ball - Casting a large ball of fire - this spell has the
                             potential to do 6 times as much damage as a normal
                             attack.   Just as it says, a large Ball of fire is
                             hurled at the opponent.

              Black Lore - Pure energy - Black Lore is the central focus of the
                           Sorcerer's faith in their Dieties.    This blast has
                           the potential to do 7 times as much damage as normal
                           attacks.

              Dispel Magic - Another one of the most useful spells that they
                             can wield, Sorcerer's have the ability to disable
                             opponent's usage of spells by casting Dispel Magic.

              Ice Storm - Just as the spell says, this spell will cause a
                          large storm of Ice to be shattered over the opponent.
                          This spell has the potential to do 9 times as much
                          damage as a normal attack.

              Clone Self - Just as the spell says, this spell will "Clone"
                           the caster's character.    On subsequent Normal
                           attacks - your "Clone" will also attack - doing
                           twice as much damage as before.

              Meteor Storm - The most potent spell in the entire game, Meteor
                             Storm can do the most damage of all spells.   It
                             has the potential to do 12 times as much damage
                             as a normal attack.    Calling upon the heavens,
                             this spell rains Meteors upon the desired target.

              Reincarnation - Possibly the most useful spell in the Sorcerer's
                              arsenal, Reincarnation does just that: bring you
                              back to life if you die.  Casting this spell any
                              time during your turn - and if you die somewhere
                              in the game, this spell will automatically bring
                              you back to life, just as if you had not died at
                              all.  Simply the most useful spell to have.

   Assassin - This type of character is the funnest character to player in the
              game.   They do not possess potent spells.  Rather, they wield a
              unique feature - "Techniques".   These Techniques can be used to
              harm other players - in "odd" ways.  Like I said, this character
              is the funnest to play!   Assassin's can wield a wide variety of
              Techniques - 3 of these can be available at the same time. These
              five Techniques are: Steal Hand Money, Scar Facial Area, View C.
              Stats, Mutilate Remains, and Destroy Bank Account.    A complete
              explanation of each of these Techniques:

              Steal Hand Money - Just as it says - using this Technique will
                                 have the chance of stealing a player's Gold
                                 on hand.

              Scar Facial Area - Using this Technique will have the chance of
                                 scarring a player, or reducing their Charisma.
                                 
              View Character Stats - This Technique, like the Spell, will view
                                     another character's statistics.   If used
                                     in conjunction with the Steal Hand Money,
                                     this will let the char know which players
                                     have more money to steal from.

              Mutilate Remains - Possibly one of the most unique Techniques
                                 available to Assassin's, Mutiliate Remains
                                 will have a chance to kill a sleeping player
                                 without the need of a battle. In short, this
                                 Technique will end the character's turn for
                                 today.

              Destroy Bank Account - Just as it says this Technique will have
                                     the chance to destroy a players Bank of
                                     Kisom account - thus, cutting off much-
                                     needed Gold.  Using this Technique will
                                     also end the character's turn for today.

   Warrior  - The Warriors are "default" characters in the Realm. Usually,
              this class is picked because players cannot decide which one
              to choose. The Warriors are like Paladin's except they can't
              wield any spells.   They *can*, however, Train once/day, and
              receive a random bonus on one of their attributes.  Warriors
              also posses a feature in ROK - the transferring of attribute
              points.  What does this mean?  It means, for example, that a
              Warrior can take 10 points away from HP, and add it onto the
              Strength.  Thus, this character would now have 10 less HP, &
              10 more strength.  There are five possible attributes that a
              Warrior can trade between - three of them are a available at
              the same time. These five attributes are: Strength, Defense,
              Charisma, HP, and Field Fights.   Warrior's can trade points
              between these attributes.   Hope that explains how it works!

   I hope that explains what each Guild Class does!

   In case you're wondering, here's a bit of ROK Nostalgia:

   First Playable      : May 22nd, 1996.
   Beta Releases       : Ten beta versions.
   Public Releases     : One, with the release of ROK v1.00.
   Internal Versions   : About 2,000,000. :-)
   Date ROK Started    : January 1st, 1996.
   Total Hours of Work : About 600 hours.
   v1.00 Release Date  : August 25th, 1996.

   Just like in a Medieval Kingdom, ROK supports the ability for the King/
   Queen of Kisom to assing "Social Rankings".   What are Social Rankings,
   you ask?  They are rankings in the eyes of the Kingdom, such as "Duke",
   "Squire", "Baron", etc.

   The King/Queen of Kisom can give out six rankings. These are: Prince,
   Princess, Duke, Dutchess, Squire, and Squiress.  As you can see from
   the names, three rankings are for Males, and three are for females.

   What are the advantages when a player receives a Social Ranking?  In
   short, this gives the player the ability to sleep in the Palace.  It
   lets them sleep at night knowing that it'll take a large sum of Gold
   for a player to Bribe the Palace Guard's into letting them challenge
   a sleeping guest.    That is the advantage a Social Ranking gives to
   players. That and the recognition in the Listings of Characters that
   it shows their Rankings.

   If a player has a Social Ranking, or is the King/Queen, they cannot
   enter the (R)ebel's Corner from the Main Menu.

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   ROK supports many "Command Line Parameters".  These Parameters are on
   the same line that you call ROK.EXE with, if you didn't know.   These
   are the list of Parameters:

   (These can be used in any order)

   *                    - Where * is the node number you wish to
                          call ROK on.  (explained above)
   0                    - Run ROK in Local Mode.
   /Bxxx                - Specify Locked Baud Rate. (Example: /B38400)
   /R                   - Forces RIP Graphics to be Enabled.
   /Pyyy                - Specify Path to your Drop File.  This can be with
                          or without the Trailing Backslash. This parameter
                          *must* be used on Multi-Node BBS's. (explained above)
   /E                   - Load files into EMS.  ROK automatically loads most
                          of it's files into EMS, if it is available, so this
                          might save just a tad more memory.  Maybe.

   ROK boasts the best RIP Graphics of all doorgames today.  If you don't
   know what RIP is, here's a brief explanation:

   RIP stands for "Remote Imaging Protocal".

   At this time, ROK supports only RipTerm 1.54, since 2.00 is *not* very
   popular, unfortunately. If 2.00 picks up in popularity or I see a wide
   demand for it, then I will make ROK support both versions.

   RIP is a form of Graphics, like ANSI, except it is in VGA mode, with
   16 Color Graphics.    At this time, I do not know of a 256 Color RIP
   Graphics Program, that is why only the 16 Colors.

   To view the RIP Screens, you will need a RIP Terminal Program.  RipTerm
   is suggested, but another that I know of supports it - Telix for Windows.
   I've heard that a version of Telemate also supports RIP, but I'm not sure
   on this one.

   What advantages does RIP have?  It allows the user to view some beautifully
   drawn artwork in the game instead of ANSI menus, and use a mouse instead of
   pressing the keyboard to execute a command.

   Regardless of whether or not your BBS Software supports RIP Graphics, ROK
   does.   This means that even if your BBS can't run RIP Graphics, ROK will
   still be able to show off it's the beautiful artwork to your users.

   Some tips on how to get players to use the game in RIP Graphics:

   1. Announce that the game has RIP Graphics.
   2. Place RipTerm v1.54 online in your File Areas for the users to download.
   3. Encourage them to test it out once, and if they like it, chances are
      they'll continue playing it in RIP mode.

   I hope the RIP Graphics section of this game is used.  It really is a great
   feature in the game!

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   Another one of ROK's many unique features is "Atma".

   Atma is made of pure energy, focused on one soul purpose - players.
   Basically, users will be able to challenge Atma once/day.  Since Atma
   is one of the strongest enemies in the game, his default variables are
   quite high, even close to that of Sakar Kane.

   If players are able to defeat Atma, their reward is that they can keep
   Atma's legendary weapon name - for the day, to make it fair to other
   players.   Upon maintenance the next day, the player's old weapon will
   be back in their hands, and they will be able to challenge Atma again.

   The weapon is three times as powerful as the most expensive weapon in
   ROK - the Ultimate Blade.  It cannot be sold, however.  :-)

   Atma is fully configurable in the ROKCFG.EXE's Editors Menu.  All
   changes will be saved when Realm of Kisom is registered.

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   Another one of ROK's many unique features is that players can Buy and
   Sell the Inn of Casimonda.

   If no player owns the Inn, then Logan, an NPC, will be the owner.   The
   default price for a player to purchase the Inn of Casimonda is $100,000.
   From there, the price will increase by 33% for another player to buy the
   Inn from that player.

   Each time the Inn is bought, the price will increase by 33%.

   How does one purchase the Inn from another player/Logan?  First of all,
   you will need the required amount of Gold.   Secondly, you will have to
   defeat the Owner in a FIST-FIGHT Battle. In short, this means that both
   players will not be able to use their weapons in the battle. The reason
   for this?  Simple.  Higher level players with more Gold will be able to
   easily defeat lower level players who Own the Inn.    Should the player
   who wishes to purchase the Inn win the fist-fight battle, s/he will then
   pay the required Gold to the previous Owner, and then acquire the rights
   to the Ownership.

   If Logan is the Owner, a player will not have to fight him, though.  :-)

   Hope that explains how it is bought and sold!

   What are the advantages of owning the Inn?  Owners are able to set the
   prices that players will have to pay to spend the night.   All profits
   made go straight to the Owner's bank account.

   No matter what, if you Own the Inn, when it is sold, you will *always*
   make a profit, since the price always increases by 33%.

   The Inn prices, ownership name, and a toggle to enable/disable the buying
   and selling of the Inn is fully configurable in ROKCFG.EXE's Editors Menu.
   All changes will be saved when Realm of Kisom is registered.

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   In case you are wondering, 3% of all taxes collected go straight to the
   King's Bank Account.  The rest goes toward "Kingdom Maintenance".  :-)

   I am 100% convinced that ROK will become an instant hit on your BBS.

   Here are some ways for you to encourage users to try out ROK:

   * Don't play the game yourself.  If players know that the SysOp is
     playing, chances are some of them will quit.  Even if you're playing
     fair, most of them will assume that you're cheating, and quit.
   * Try not to run too many Doors on your BBS.  Even if you have a lot
     of doors, if you have 30 Door users, chances are there will be only
     3 to 5 players in each door.  Limitting the amount of doors will
     make the players choose the same game all the time to play.  Even if
     you only have ROK online, chances are most players will call more to
     your BBS because they *know* they will find players in your game.
   * Advertise the game in your opening BBS Screen.  This will let players
     know that the game has been installed on your BBS.  Let them know that
     it's a great game, RIP Compatible, etc.  Chances are, from your promo,
     that they'll join up right away.  A file is included in the archive to
     help you with this promotion - the ANSI Filename is "ROKPROMO.ANS".
   * Make it easily accessable.  Nothing's worse than hitting three to four
     keys to reach the door game's menu.  I have it available right from the
     Main Menu on my BBS, and it works great!
   * When you register, don't overdo the amount of Field/Player Fights you
     are giving out per day.  Too much and the game goes way too quickly.
     The default (15 Field Fights, 3 Player Fights) is there to make ROK run
     at a balanced pace.

³ Realm of Kisom Version 1.00      Page 8 - Contacting Devon Brooks, Author ³

   You want to get in contact with me, Devon Brooks, The Author?  GREAT!

   I simply *LOVE* receiving messages!  (Really, I do!)

   Here are some of the most convenient ways of contacting me:

   1. FidoNet EchoMail Message Areas.  I frequently read the DOORGAMES Echo
      and the ON_LINE_GAMES Echo.

      Hopefully soon, there will be a ROK echo available on Plannet Connect.
      If this becomes available, I will, of course, answer messages in here as
      well, since it *IS* an entire echo devoted to my game. :-)

      Since I receive a LOT of messages every day, chances are you won't get
      a reply back very quickly.   It usually takes me 1-2 days to answer my
      mail completely.   Depending on where you live, please allow 5-10 days
      for a reply to come back to you. It's also in here that I announce new
      releases of ROK, so keep up in these echos, and you'll be kept informed!

   2. Netmail.  My FidoNet Netmail Address is 1:140/129.

      It doesn't matter if you route the Netmail message or crash it to me.
      In most cases, I will route the reply back to you, but sometimes, if it
      is urgent, I will crash it back to you.  I usually answer my Netmail
      messages as soon as I can, so this might be the best method of getting
      in contact with me.

   3. Internet E-Mail.  My Internet Address is "bfs@sk.sympatico.ca",
      without the quotes ("").

      I usually check my Mail on the Internet about every 2 days.  However,
      that does not mean you will get a reply in 2 days.  It will most likely
      take about 4 days for me to reply to your message on here.  Depending
      on the urgency of the message, though, I could reply back right away.

   4. Voice Support!  My Voice Phone Number is 1-306-692-7374.  Please call
      between 6pm and 9pm Central Standard Time (CST).  Please check *YOUR*
      time zone, then check the difference of time between yours and mine,
      THEN decide when to call.  What I mean is that if you are two hours
      behind me, then call between 4pm and 7pm in your area, since that is
      the equivalent to 6pm and 9pm in my area.  Does that make sense?  Hope
      so.  There's nothing worse, in my opinion, than receiving a voice call
      when I'm supposed to be sleeping! :-)

      Voice support is probably the quickest method of contacting me.  It's
      person-to-person, so that your questions are answered directly by me.

      In case you didn't know, I am 16 years old.  Thus, I might not be home
      sometimes, and my parents might answer.  If that is the case, simply
      tell them that you will call back another time, and hopefully I will be
      home at that time.  To make your life a bit easier, I have tennis league
      nights on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday all this summer, so try not to
      call those nights.

      When I answer the phone, please notify me that you are calling for ROK
      assistance.  Otherwise, I might think you are a friend of mine calling
      me up, and I won't treat you with the courteousness I should. :-)

   5. The Author's BBS.  My BBS is "The Inner City BBS".  The Phone Number is
      1-306-694-5864.  This BBS is open 24 hours/day, 7 days a week.  Your 1st
      call will simply be a verification call; after I've updated your access
      level, you will have full access to the BBS.  Sorry I don't allow full
      access on first call, but I've got a lot of "troublesome" users in my
      area who like to abuse full-access-upon-first-call BBS's.

      The verification call will take less than two minutes, tops.  Simply
      call back the next day, or even later in the day, and you will have
      normal access.  I usually check the BBS every 2-4 hours, so it won't
      take that long to verify you.

      If you leave me a message in a local area on my BBS, I will usually
      reply to it within 2-4 hours of seeing it.  This is a quick method of
      getting a reply.  There is a specific message area setup JUST for ROK
      comments/suggestions/bug reports.  That is Message Area #2 on my BBS.
      If you wish to write me a message on my BBS, this is the area to do it
      in.  However, if you want it to be a private message, there's always
      the local message area as well.  Doesn't matter to me at all.

   6. The *Official* Blazing Fire Software Web Site.

      The WWW address is: Http://www.sasknet.com/~bfs

      If you don't know how to make the "~", it's the top left hand key on
      the Keyboard, plus the Shift Button.  :-)  Some people ask me how to
      make it.  I call it a "Squiggley".

      On this WWW Site, you can always find the latest version of ROK here.
      You can also see upcoming programs from Blazing Fire Software, info
      regarding new upcoming releases of ROK, and E-Mail Devon Brooks, The
      Author, directly from this site!

      This WWW site was created and is maintained by Devon Brooks.

   7. Almost as a last resort:

      Mail.  Plain, ordinary "Snail" Mail.  My address is:

      Devon Brooks
      c/o 834 Ninth Avenue NW
      Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan
      Canada
      S6H 2M5

      This is also the address to send Registration Forms.  If you specify
      an alternative way to reply besides Snail Mail, I will reply in that
      form. Otherwise, you will receive a reply in the mail 2-4 weeks after
      you sent it, depending on where you live.

   I *LOVE* receiving messages from people.  If you have a question, comment,
   suggestion, bug report, even if you just want to start a conversation - let
   me know about it! :-)

   Boy, when I think of the time I originally thought of ROK.....

   First of all, above everyone and everything else, I thank God. God gave
   me the ability to exercise patience in programming my game, patience in
   the time it took to complete it, the knowledge of Turbo Pascal, &, most
   of all, a happy life to live.

   Secondly, I thank my family.  My parents, for their support when I was
   feeling down because of an elusive Bug. And, even my big brother, whom
   I fought with immensely when I was a kid.

   Thirdly, a good friend of mine, Brad Berezowski.  Brad was there from the
   very beginning, offering suggestions, comments - and sometimes insults to
   me.  He thought of many features that ROK has.  Though he didn't actually
   code any part of ROK, he was a driving force behind ROK's creation.

   Next, I thank Bill Klassen.  He gave me the User Routines for ROK, how to
   save/find a user record, and much, much more.  He gave me countless hours
   of work.  He offered much needed help, support, and more.   In short, ROK
   would not exist if Bill had not helped me out. And, for that, I thank him
   immensely.

   The beta testers.  Where would I be without them?  God only knows...  Here
   is a list of them, in no particular order: John Wagontall, Brian Tremblay,
   Chris Carson, Glen Moorehead, Mark Tassin, Ken Gray, Joe Clarke, Dan Shore,
   Tom Brown, and Dale Ficken. These people reported bugs, typo's, etc, & also
   gave some great suggestions for new options in the game.  I simply do not
   know where ROK would be without the aid of these beta testers.  This list
   of testers is also given in the file TESTERS.DOC, included in the archive.

   Next, I thank Sean Mellor.  He took the time to draw some of ROK's awesome
   ANSI graphics.  Thanks a million, Sean! :-)

   Steve Lorenz, Bob Dalton, Scott Baker, and everyone else who contributed
   to the DDPlus Package.  Simply the *BEST* DoorDriver available for TP.

   I thank Jan Ferguson from the TURBO PASCAL Echo (FidoNet) for providing
   me with assistance in regards to taking percentages of values.  Thanks a
   lot, Jan!

   Finally, I thank a lot of the users on my BBS.  They reported inital bugs
   in the Alpha version of ROK, contributed suggestions/comments, and more.

   That is all that I can think of at this point.  If I missed anyone, please
   tell me, and I'll update this Documentation in the next version! :-)

   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   Also, if you feel I have missed something in this documentation, or I have
   not convered something in the game, *please* notify me of this, and I will
   update this Documentation in the next version.

   ** I enjoyed writing ROK immensely!  I hope you have fun with it! **
